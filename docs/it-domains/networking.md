# Networking

Computer networking is the process of connecting computers and devices together in order to share data and resources. Networks can be small, like a home network, or large, like the Internet. Networks can be wired, wireless, or a combination of both. Networking is a key part of computing, as it allows computers to communicate with each other and share data. For example, if you wanted to share a photo with a friend, you could use a computer network to send it to them. Networks can also be used to share resources, such as printers and scanners, or to give users access to remote data, such as files stored on another computer.

## Tools

There are many different computer networking tools that can be used to manage and monitor networked devices and systems. Some of the most common tools include network management software, network monitoring tools, and network troubleshooting tools. Network management software is used to manage the network infrastructure, including routers, switches, and other devices. This software can be used to monitor network traffic, configure devices, and troubleshoot problems.
