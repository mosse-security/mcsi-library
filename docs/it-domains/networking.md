# Networking

Computer networking is the process of connecting computers and devices together in order to share data and resources. Networks can be small, like a home network, or large, like the Internet. Networks can be wired, wireless, or a combination of both. Networking is a key part of computing, as it allows computers to communicate with each other and share data. For example, if you wanted to share a photo with a friend, you could use a computer network to send it to them. Networks can also be used to share resources, such as printers and scanners, or to give users access to remote data, such as files stored on another computer.
