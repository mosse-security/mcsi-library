# Programming & Scripting

Programming is the process of designing a step by step plan that will make a computer do what you want it to. In order to create a program, you need a clear understanding of the problem you are trying to solve and the steps that need to be taken in order to solve it. Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, you can begin to design your program. There are many different programming languages that you can use to write a program. The language you choose will depend on the type of problem you are trying to solve and the resources you have available. Some languages are designed for specific types of problems, while others are more general purpose.

## PowerShell

PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that enables administrators to automate many tasks on Windows systems. PowerShell can be used to perform a wide variety of tasks, such as managing users and groups, working with files and folders, managing registry keys, and much more. PowerShell is also an interactive shell that can be used to execute commands on remote systems.

## YAML

YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". It is a human-readable data serialization format that is often used for configuration files and data exchange. YAML is a superset of JSON, which means that any valid JSON file is also a valid YAML file.
