# Cloud Services

Cloud services are a type of internet-based computing that provide shared computer processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. They are sometimes referred to as "on-demand computing" or "utility computing". Cloud services are a way to provide a more flexible and scalable approach to computing than traditional on-premises models. Cloud services are delivered through a network of data centers that are connected to each other through the internet. When a user needs computing resources, they can request them from a cloud service provider. The provider then allocates the resources from their pool of available resources and delivers them to the user over the internet.

## Terminology

Cloud terminology can be confusing for those who are not familiar with the technology. In this section, we will define some of the key terms that are used when discussing cloud computing.

## AWS

AWS is a cloud computing platform that offers a wide variety of services, including but not limited to storage, computing, and networking. It is one of the most popular cloud platforms on the market, and is used by many large organizations. AWS is a highly scalable and flexible platform that can be used to build a wide variety of applications. It offers a number of features that make it an attractive option for developers, including but not limited to its pay-as-you-go pricing model, its wide range of services, and its ease of use.

## GCP

Google Cloud Platform, or GCP, is a set of cloud computing services that run on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, file storage, and streaming videos. GCP offers a set of managed services that are designed to meet the needs of large-scale computing, data analysis, storage, and networking. GCP also provides a set of developer tools that can be used to build, test, and deploy applications on the platform.

## Docker

Docker is a tool that enables developers to create, deploy, and run applications inside isolated containers. By using containers, developers can package an application with all of its dependencies and ship it as a single unit. This makes it much easier to deploy and run applications in different environments, without having to worry about dependencies or configuration issues.

## Terraform

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. Infrastructure as code Infrastructure is composed of physical and virtual resources that can be provisioned, changed, and destroyed. Terraform abstracts away the details of the underlying infrastructure and allows Infrastructure as Code (IaC). With IaC, operators can manage infrastructure by writing code rather than manually configuring resources. Benefits of using Terraform There are many benefits of using Terraform to manage your infrastructure.
