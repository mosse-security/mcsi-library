# Cloud Services

Cloud services are a type of internet-based computing that provide shared computer processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. They are sometimes referred to as "on-demand computing" or "utility computing". Cloud services are a way to provide a more flexible and scalable approach to computing than traditional on-premises models. Cloud services are delivered through a network of data centers that are connected to each other through the internet. When a user needs computing resources, they can request them from a cloud service provider. The provider then allocates the resources from their pool of available resources and delivers them to the user over the internet.
