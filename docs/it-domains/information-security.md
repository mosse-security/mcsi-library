# Information Security

Information security is the practice of protecting electronic information by mitigating information risks and vulnerabilities. Information risks can include unauthorized access, use, disclosure, interception, or destruction of data. Data can include, but is not limited to, the confidential information of business or individual users. Data can be stored on physical media, such as hard drives and servers, or in electronic form, such as in databases and email systems. To protect data, information security practitioners implement security controls, which can be either technical or non-technical in nature. Technical controls are designed to protect data through the use of security technologies, such as firewalls, encryption, and access control systems.
