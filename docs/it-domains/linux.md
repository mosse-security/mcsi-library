# Linux

Linus Torvalds created the Linux operating system (OS) in 1991 under license from the Free Software Foundation. Since then, thousands of computer programmers have contributed to its development. Because of this extensive programming, Linux is a stable and reliable OS capable of running  multiprocessor computers.

## Using the Command Line

Linux command line is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with the operating system. It provides a way to issue commands to the system, which can be used to perform various tasks. The command line can be accessed by using a terminal emulator, which can be found in most Linux distributions.
