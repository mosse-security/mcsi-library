## Principles and Key Ideas

There are several cyber security principles that are important to consider when protecting your online information. The first principle is confidentiality, which refers to the need to keep information private and secure. This is important because if information is leaked, it can be used to exploit vulnerabilities or commit fraud. The second principle is integrity, which means that information should be accurate and reliable. This is important because if information is inaccurate, it can lead to incorrect decisions being made. The third principle is availability, which refers to the need to keep information accessible to those who need it.

## Endpoint Security

Endpoint security is a term that refers to the measures taken to protect the endpoint devices in a network from being compromised. These measures can include both hardware and software solutions, and they are designed to prevent unauthorized access to the devices and to the data they contain. The term “endpoint” refers to any device that has the potential to connect to a network, including computers, laptops, smartphones, and tablets. Endpoint security is therefore a critical part of overall network security. There are a number of different ways to secure endpoint devices, including the use of firewalls, anti-virus software, and encryption. In many cases, a combination of these methods is used to provide the most comprehensive protection possible.

## Logging and Monitoring

Logging and monitoring are two essential tools for any system administrator. Logging allows you to track events and activity on your system, while monitoring provides real-time visibility into what is happening on your system. Logging is essential for understanding what has happened on your system in the past. By reviewing log files, you can track down issues and identify potential problems. Monitoring, on the other hand, gives you a real-time view of what is happening on your system. This can be invaluable for spotting issues as they are happening and taking corrective action. Both logging and monitoring are essential tools for any system administrator.

## Cryptography

Cryptography is the practice of secure communication in the presence of third parties. Its origins date back to ancient times, when people first developed ways to encode messages to keep them private. Today, cryptography is used in a variety of applications, from secure communications to data security. Encryption is a key component of cryptography. It is a process of transforming readable data into an unreadable format, making it difficult for unauthorized parties to access the information. Encryption is used in a variety of settings, from ensuring the privacy of communications to protecting data at rest. The growth of cryptographic technology has been driven by the need for secure communication and data security. As the world becomes more connected, the need for strong cryptography will only continue to grow.

## Hypervisor Security

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor, is a software program that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor allows multiple operating systems (OSes) to share a single physical host computer. Each virtual machine has its own virtual hardware, including a virtual CPU, memory, storage, and network adapters. Hypervisor security is a critical concern for organizations that use this technology. A hypervisor can be thought of as a mini operating system that controls access to physical resources. If a hypervisor is compromised, an attacker could gain access to all the virtual machines running on that host, as well as the host itself.

## Active Directory

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service that Microsoft developed for Windows domain networks. It is included in most Windows Server operating systems as a set of processes and services. Active Directory is an authoritative source for identifying, authenticating, and authorizing all users and computers in a Windows domain network. AD is also a repository for other objects such as applications, devices, and services. Security is a primary concern for any organization that relies on Active Directory to manage its data and resources. AD security is achieved through a combination of security configuration, authentication, and authorization.

## Authentication Security

Authentication security is the process of verifying the identity of a user or process. This is typically done through the use of a username and password, but can also involve other factors such as biometrics or tokens. The goal of authentication security is to ensure that only authorized users are able to access a given system or resource. There are a number of different approaches that can be used for authentication security. The most common is to use some form of credential, such as a username and password. This approach is often supplemented with additional factors, such as a one-time code generated by a token device or biometric data such as a fingerprint or iris scan.

## Zero Trust

Zero trust is a security model that requires strict verification of users before allowing them access to data or systems. In a zero trust security model, all users are treated as untrusted, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the network perimeter. This approach is designed to address the shortcomings of the traditional security perimeter, which assumes that all users inside the perimeter are trustworthy and all users outside the perimeter are untrusted.
