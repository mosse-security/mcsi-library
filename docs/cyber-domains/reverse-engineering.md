# Reverse Engineering

Reverse engineering is the process of taking something apart and figuring out how it works. In the context of cyber security, reverse engineering can be used to figure out how a piece of malware works, or to find vulnerabilities in a piece of software. Reverse engineering is an important tool for security researchers, as it allows them to better understand how systems work and identify potential weaknesses.
