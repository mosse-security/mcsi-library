# Secure Software Development

There is no question that security is important in the software development process. Unfortunately, it is often an afterthought, which can lead to big problems down the road. By taking a few simple steps to secure your code and development process, you can avoid many of the most common security issues.

**Secure coding** is the practice of developing software in a way that protects it from vulnerabilities and attacks. Secure software development is a process that includes secure coding, but also includes other security measures such as design review, testing, and deployment. 

**Software exploitation** is a process of attacking a software system in order to take control of it or gain access to its data. This can be done by finding and exploiting a weakness in the software code, or by reverse engineering the software to find a way to bypass its security measures.
