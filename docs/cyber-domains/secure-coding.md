# Secure Software Development

There is no question that security is important in the software development process. Unfortunately, it is often an afterthought, which can lead to big problems down the road. By taking a few simple steps to secure your code and development process, you can avoid many of the most common security issues.

Secure coding is the practice of developing software in a way that protects it from vulnerabilities and attacks. Secure software development is a process that includes secure coding, but also includes other security measures such as design review, testing, and deployment.

## Web Application Vulnerabilities

Web application vulnerabilities are weaknesses that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or to perform other malicious actions. Common web application vulnerabilities include SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and session hijacking.

## Threat Modelling

Threat modeling is a process of identifying security threats and vulnerabilities in a system. It is a proactive approach to security that helps organizations to identify, assess and mitigate risks. Threat modeling can be used to identify threats and vulnerabilities in any system, whether it is a computer system, a network, an application, or even a physical facility. The process of threat modeling involves identifying the assets and data that are most important to protect, and then identifying the threats and vulnerabilities that could potentially compromise those assets and data. Once the threats and vulnerabilities have been identified, they can be mitigated or controlled through the implementation of security controls.

## Secure Coding

Secure coding is the practice of developing computer software in a way that protects it from vulnerabilities and security risks. This can be done by following security best practices, using security tools and services, and by keeping up to date with new security risks and vulnerabilities. Developing software in a secure manner is important not only for the safety of the software itself, but also for the safety of the people and organizations that use it. Software security risks can lead to data loss, financial loss, and even physical harm.
