# Governance, Risk and Compliance

Governance, risk and compliance (GRC) is a term that refers to the integrated approach an organization takes to managing its business processes, handling risk and ensuring compliance with regulations. By taking a GRC approach, organizations can improve their overall performance, better manage risk and protect themselves from potential regulatory penalties.

Once these risks are identified, the organization can put in place controls to mitigate them. It's important to involve all stakeholders in the GRC process, from the board of directors to front-line employees, so that everyone is aware of the risks and knows their role in mitigating them.
