# Vulnerability Research

Vulnerability research is the process of identifying, analyzing and trying to exploit weaknesses in computer systems and software. Exploit development is the creation of tools or code that can take advantage of these vulnerabilities to gain access to or damage a system. Vulnerability research is an important part of security for both companies and individuals. By finding and publicizing vulnerabilities, researchers can help make systems and software more secure. They can also help find ways to protect against future attacks. Exploit development is a more controversial activity.

## Procedures

```{admonition} What is a procedure and a workflow and why are they important?
:class: tip
A procedure is a set of instructions that detail how to carry out a task. It is important to have procedures in place so that tasks can be carried out efficiently and consistently. Having a procedure ensures that everyone knows what needs to be done and how to do it. This can help to avoid confusion and mistakes.

A workflow is a series of steps that are followed in order to complete an engagement. In vulnerability research, a workflow is important in order to ensure that all steps are followed in order to complete the testing process. By following a workflow, researchers can ensure that they are thorough in their testing and that they do not miss any important steps.

## Windows

Windows is a popular operating system used by many individuals and organizations around the world. Given its widespread use, Windows is often the target of malicious actors who seek to exploit vulnerabilities for a variety of purposes. As such, Windows vulnerability research and exploit development is a critical area of focus for the security community. There are a number of ways to conduct Windows vulnerability research and exploit development.

## Linux

Linux is a popular operating system that is often used for servers and other high-powered computers. However, like any operating system, it is not immune to vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious actors in order to gain access to sensitive data or systems. Researchers who wish to study Linux vulnerabilities and develop exploits for them must have a good understanding of the operating system and how it works. They must also be familiar with common security vulnerabilities and how to exploit them.
