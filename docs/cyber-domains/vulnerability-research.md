# Vulnerability Research

```{admonition} What is Vulnerability Research and Exploitation?
:class: dropdown

Vulnerability research is the process of identifying, analyzing and trying to exploit weaknesses in computer systems and software. Exploit development is the creation of tools or code that can take advantage of these vulnerabilities to gain access to or damage a system. Vulnerability research is an important part of security for both companies and individuals. By finding and publicizing vulnerabilities, researchers can help make systems and software more secure. They can also help find ways to protect against future attacks. Exploit development is a more controversial activity.

## Free Video Course

Are you interested in learning more about vulnerability research and exploitation? Then our free video course is perfect for you! Our comprehensive course covers everything from the fundamentals of security and vulnerability assessments to the latest techniques in exploitation and attack techniques. You'll learn the ins and outs of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities, as well as how to use various tools and techniques to develop your own exploits. It's a great way to get up to speed with the latest trends in the field, and you'll have the skills and knowledge to be a successful security researcher.

### Chapter 1: Introduction

Vulnerability research is an important field in the world of information security. It involves exploring system weaknesses and vulnerabilities and then developing solutions to fix those weaknesses. In this video course, we will be exploring the key terminology relevant to vulnerability research, explaining why and how it is done, setting up a lab environment to conduct research, and exploring the tools used to perform vulnerability research. By the end of the course, you will have a good understanding of the key concepts, techniques, and tools used in vulnerability research.

### Windows

Windows is a popular operating system used by many individuals and organizations around the world. Given its widespread use, Windows is often the target of malicious actors who seek to exploit vulnerabilities for a variety of purposes. As such, Windows vulnerability research and exploit development is a critical area of focus for the security community. There are a number of ways to conduct Windows vulnerability research and exploit development.

### Linux

Linux is a popular operating system that is often used for servers and other high-powered computers. However, like any operating system, it is not immune to vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious actors in order to gain access to sensitive data or systems. Researchers who wish to study Linux vulnerabilities and develop exploits for them must have a good understanding of the operating system and how it works. They must also be familiar with common security vulnerabilities and how to exploit them.

## Workflow

```{admonition} What is a workflow?
:class: dropdown

A workflow is a series of steps that are followed in order to complete an engagement. In penetration testing, a workflow is important in order to ensure that all steps are followed in order to complete the testing process. By following a workflow, penetration testers can ensure that they are thorough in their testing and that they do not miss any important steps.
