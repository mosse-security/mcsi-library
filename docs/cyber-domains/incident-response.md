# Incident Response

Incident response is the process of identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering from a security incident. It is a proactive and reactive measure taken to protect an organization's information assets and infrastructure. The goal of incident response is to minimize the damage caused by an incident and to restore normal operations as quickly as possible. 

An effective incident response plan can help organizations to quickly and effectively identify and contain security incidents, minimize the damage they cause, and get back to business as usual as quickly as possible.

## Procedures and Workflows

```{admonition} What is a procedure and a workflow and why are they important?
:class: tip
Incident response procedures and workflow are important in helping to ensure that incidents are handled in a consistent and effective manner. Having well-defined procedures and a clear workflow can help to ensure that incidents are dealt with quickly and efficiently, and that the appropriate people are notified and involved in the response.

## Data Collection

In any incident response, data collection is a critical first step. This data can come from a variety of sources, including network and host-based intrusion detection systems, system and application logs, and even direct observation. The data collected during this phase can be used to determine the scope of the incident, identify the systems and data affected, and begin to piece together what happened.
