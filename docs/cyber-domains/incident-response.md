# Incident Response

Incident response is the process of identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering from a security incident. It is a proactive and reactive measure taken to protect an organization's information assets and infrastructure. The goal of incident response is to minimize the damage caused by an incident and to restore normal operations as quickly as possible. 

An effective incident response plan can help organizations to quickly and effectively identify and contain security incidents, minimize the damage they cause, and get back to business as usual as quickly as possible.
