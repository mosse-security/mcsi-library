# Threat Hunting

Threat hunting is a security practice that involves proactively searching for signs of malware or malicious activity on a companyâ€™s network. The goal of threat hunting is to find and stop attacks before they cause damage. Threat hunting is a relatively new security practice, but it is gaining popularity as more companies become aware of the benefits it can offer. By proactively searching for signs of malware or malicious activity, threat hunters can help find and stop attacks before they cause damage. Threat hunting can be a valuable addition to any security program, and companies that are serious about protecting their data should consider adding it to their security arsenal.

## Procedures

```{admonition} What is a procedure and a workflow and why are they important?
:class: dropdown
A procedure is a set of instructions that detail how to carry out a task. It is important to have procedures in place so that tasks can be carried out efficiently and consistently. Having a procedure ensures that everyone knows what needs to be done and how to do it. This can help to avoid confusion and mistakes.

A workflow is a series of steps that are followed in order to complete an engagement or a mission. In Threat Hunting, a workflow is important in order to ensure that all steps are followed in order to complete the testing process. By following a workflow, Threat Hunters can ensure that they are thorough in their tests and that they do not miss any important steps.

### Webshells

Webshells are malicious scripts that can be uploaded to a web server in order to gain control of the server. They are often used to take over a server by adding, modifying, or deleting files, and can also be used to execute arbitrary commands on the server. Webshells can be written in any scripting language, but are most commonly written in PHP or ASP.

### YARA

YARA is a powerful tool for reverse engineering malware. It can be used to identify and classify malware, and to find and extract specific features from malware samples. YARA can also be used to create signatures that can be used to detect and block malware.
