# Threat Intelligence

Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is information that enables organizations to understand the nature, source, and intent of cyber threats. This information can be used to support organizational decision-making in order to defend against or mitigate these threats. CTI can be derived from a variety of sources, including technical data, human intelligence, and open-source information. Organizations can use CTI to support a variety of activities, including identifying and prioritizing threats, developing and implementing mitigation strategies, and tracking the effectiveness of these strategies over time. CTI can also be used to support incident response and forensics activities.
