# Red Teaming

Red Teaming is a security testing method that simulates a real-world attack on an organization's systems and infrastructure. It is an important cybersecurity activity for organizations to use in order to identify weaknesses in their security posture and to harden their defenses against potential attacks. Red Teaming can help organizations to identify and fix vulnerabilities before they are exploited by attackers. Additionally, Red Teaming can help organizations to develop better incident response plans and to test their ability to detect and respond to attacks.
