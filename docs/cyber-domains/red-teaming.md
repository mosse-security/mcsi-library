# Red Teaming

Red Teaming is a security testing method that simulates a real-world attack on an organization's systems and infrastructure. It is an important cybersecurity activity for organizations to use in order to identify weaknesses in their security posture and to harden their defenses against potential attacks. Red Teaming can help organizations to identify and fix vulnerabilities before they are exploited by attackers. Additionally, Red Teaming can help organizations to develop better incident response plans and to test their ability to detect and respond to attacks.

## Concepts

```{admonition} Why is learning fundamental Red Team concepts important?
:class: dropdown
A concept is an abstract idea that represents a general understanding of something. It is important to learn fundamental Red Team concepts because they provide a foundation for understanding more complex ideas. Concepts help us make sense of the world and communicate our thoughts and ideas to others. They are the building blocks of knowledge and the key to unlocking our potential.

## Procedures

```{admonition} What is a procedure and a workflow and why are they important?
:class: dropdown
A procedure is a set of instructions that detail how to carry out a task. It is important to have procedures in place so that tasks can be carried out efficiently and consistently. Having a procedure ensures that everyone knows what needs to be done and how to do it. This can help to avoid confusion and mistakes.

A workflow is a series of steps that are followed in order to complete an engagement or a mission. In Red Teaming, a workflow is important in order to ensure that all steps are followed in order to complete the testing process. By following a workflow, Red Teamers can ensure that they are thorough in their tests and that they do not miss any important steps.
