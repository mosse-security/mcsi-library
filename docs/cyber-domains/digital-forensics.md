# Digital Forensics

Digital forensics is the science of acquiring, analyzing and reporting on digital evidence. It can be used to investigate crimes such as child pornography, terrorism, and fraud. It can also be used to recover data from damaged or corrupted devices.

Digital forensics is a rapidly growing field, as more and more crimes are committed using digital devices. The field requires a strong understanding of computer science and investigation techniques.

## Windows Forensics

Windows forensics is the process of using investigative techniques to collect, analyze, and report data about a digital event that occurred on a computing device running the Microsoft Windows operating system. The data collected can be used to answer questions about what happened, when it happened, how it happened, and who was involved. Windows forensics is a specialized form of digital forensics that is designed to take advantage of the unique features and capabilities of the Windows operating system. Because of the way that Windows stores data and tracks activity, forensics investigators can use Windows forensics techniques to gain a more complete understanding of a digital event.

## Linux Forensics

Linux forensics is the process of using investigative techniques to collect, analyze, and report on evidence from a Linux system. Linux forensics is a critical tool for investigating incidents on Linux systems. When an incident occurs, forensics can be used to identify the cause, confirm the identity of the attacker, and gather evidence for prosecution. Linux forensics is a complex process, and there are many tools and techniques that can be used to collect and analyze evidence. In order to be effective, Linux forensics must be tailored to the specific needs of the investigation.

## Memory Forensics

In computer security, memory forensics is the art of acquiring and analyzing digital evidence from a computer's memory dump. Memory forensics is a critical component of incident response, as it can provide insight into what a malicious actor was doing on a system prior to being detected. Memory forensics is a relatively new field, and as such, there are a limited number of tools and techniques available to practitioners. However, memory forensics is a critical tool in the arsenal of any security professional, as it can provide insights that would otherwise be unavailable.

## Browser Forensics

Browser forensics is the process of using forensic tools and techniques to examine web browsers and collect evidence of web-based activity. This process can be used to investigate a wide variety of crimes, including cybercrime, fraud, and child exploitation. There are a number of different ways to collect evidence from a web browser, including examining web browser history, cookies, and cached files.
