# Digital Forensics

Digital forensics is the science of acquiring, analyzing and reporting on digital evidence. It can be used to investigate crimes such as child pornography, terrorism, and fraud. It can also be used to recover data from damaged or corrupted devices.

Digital forensics is a rapidly growing field, as more and more crimes are committed using digital devices. The field requires a strong understanding of computer science and investigation techniques.

## Concepts

```{admonition} Why is learning fundamental Digital Forensics concepts important?
:class: dropdown
A concept is an abstract idea that represents a general understanding of something. Digital forensics concepts are important in today's digital world because they help us to understand how to collect, preserve and analyse digital evidence.

## Procedures

```{admonition} What is a procedure and a workflow and why are they important in Digital Forensics?

:class: dropdown
A digital forensic procedure is a set of instructions for conducting a digital forensic investigation. It is important to have procedures in place so that tasks can be carried out efficiently and consistently.

A digital forensic workflow is a series of steps that are followed in order to complete a digital forensic investigation. Digital forensics procedures and workflow are important in order to ensure that data is collected and analyzed correctly.

## Techniques

```{admonition} Why is learning Digital Forensics techniques important?
:class: dropdown
Digital forensics techniques are important in helping to investigate and prosecute crimes that have been committed using computers or other digital devices. These techniques can help to recover evidence that may have been deleted or hidden, and they can also be used to track down the culprits behind the crimes.
