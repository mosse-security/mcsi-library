# Digital Forensics

Digital forensics is the science of acquiring, analyzing and reporting on digital evidence. It can be used to investigate crimes such as child pornography, terrorism, and fraud. It can also be used to recover data from damaged or corrupted devices.

Digital forensics is a rapidly growing field, as more and more crimes are committed using digital devices. The field requires a strong understanding of computer science and investigation techniques.

Digital forensics investigators must be able to identify and preserve evidence, while also being able to understand and interpret it. They must also be able to write clear and concise reports.
