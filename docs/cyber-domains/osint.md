# Open Source Intelligence

Open Source Intelligence, or OSINT, is the process of collecting, analyzing, and using publicly available information to support decision making. This information can come from a variety of sources, including social media, news articles, websites, and more. OSINT is a valuable tool for organizations of all types, as it can provide insights that would otherwise be unavailable.
