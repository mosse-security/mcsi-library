```{admonition} What is Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)?
:class: dropdown

Open Source Intelligence, or OSINT, is the process of collecting, analyzing, and using publicly available information to support decision making. This information can come from a variety of sources, including social media, news articles, websites, and more. OSINT is a valuable tool for organizations of all types, as it can provide insights that would otherwise be unavailable.

### Geospatial

Geospatial OSINT is the process of collecting and analyzing data from publicly available sources in order to gain insights about a given location. This data can come in the form of satellite imagery, maps, aerial photographs, and even social media posts. By analyzing this data, one can gain a better understanding of the location in question, including its infrastructure, terrain, and even the people who live there. Geospatial OSINT can be a valuable tool for a variety of purposes, such as military intelligence, disaster relief, and law enforcement.

### Social Media

Social Media OSINT refers to the process of using social media platforms to gather intelligence about individuals or groups. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to monitor potential threats, to gather information about a target, or to track the spread of information. There are a number of different ways to go about Social Media OSINT, but the most common method is to simply search for relevant information on the platform itself. This can be done by looking through public posts, looking at the profiles of individuals or groups, or using search engines to find specific information. Another common method is to use social media monitoring tools, which can help to automate the process of gathering intelligence from social media platforms.

### Business

Business OSINT is the process of gathering information from public sources in order to gain insights into business opportunities or threats. This process can be used to gather information about a company's products, competitors, or even its financial health. By analyzing this information, businesses can make better informed decisions about where to invest their resources. Business OSINT can be a valuable tool for any company, large or small. However, it is important to remember that not all information gathered from public sources is accurate or reliable. When using business OSINT, it is important to verify the accuracy of the information before making any decisions.

### People

There are many OSINT techniques that can be used to investigate people. One common technique is to use public records to find information about a person's background, including their criminal history, financial history, and other important details. Another popular OSINT technique is to use social media to find information about a person. This can include looking at their posts, their friends, and their activity to get an idea of who they are and what they're interested in. Finally, another common OSINT technique is to use Google to find information about a person. This can include looking for their name, their address, their phone number, and anything else that might be useful in an investigation.

### Email

Email OSINT is a process of using publicly available information to gather intelligence about a target email address. This can include using search engines to find information about the email address, looking up the email address in public databases, and using social media to find information about the owner of the email address. Email OSINT can be a valuable tool for investigations, as it can help to identify the owner of an email address, their location, and their online activity.

### Search Engines

Search engines are a powerful tool for collecting OSINT (open-source intelligence). They can be used to find websites, document repositories, blogs, and other online resources that contain information that can be used for intelligence purposes. Search engines work by indexing the content of web pages and making that content searchable. When a user enters a query into a search engine, the search engine searches its index for web pages that contain the query terms and returns a list of those pages. The most popular search engines, such as Google and Bing, are commercial entities that make money by selling advertising. However, there are also many open-source and non-commercial search engines, such as DuckDuckGo and Yandex.

### Images

Images posted on social media contain EXIF data that can be used to extract valuable information, such as the location where the image was taken, the make and model of the camera used, and the date and time the image was taken. Another study found that a large majority of people who use social media also post images of themselves, their friends, and their activities. This provides a rich source of information that can be used to build detailed profiles of individuals and groups.

### Domain Names

Domain names can provide a wealth of information through OSINT techniques. By analyzing the DNS (Domain Name System) records associated with a domain, it is possible to glean a great deal of information about the domain and its owner. DNS records can provide information about the hosting provider for a domain, the IP addresses associated with the domain, and the mail servers associated with the domain. This information can be used to help identify the owner of a domain, as well as the location of the domain's servers. In addition, through the use of whois lookups, it is possible to obtain contact information for the owner of a domain.

### Shodan

Shodan is a computer search engine that lets users find specific types of devices connected to the internet. It's commonly used by security researchers to find vulnerable devices and systems. Shodan is different from other search engines like Google and Bing because it doesn't index websites; instead, it indexes the devices and services that are connected to the internet. This makes it possible to find devices that are running vulnerable software, exposed login pages, and open ports. Shodan is a powerful tool for security researchers and it can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes. For example, researchers can use Shodan to find devices that are running outdated software and then work on developing exploits for those devices.

### Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are a type of digital asset that uses cryptography to secure its transactions and to control the creation of new units of the currency. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, meaning they are not subject to government or financial institution control. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies are often traded on decentralized exchanges and can also be used to purchase goods and services. Cryptocurrencies are a relatively new phenomenon and as such, there is a lack of regulation and clarity around them. This lack of regulation has led to some concerns being raised about their use, including their use in illegal activities.
