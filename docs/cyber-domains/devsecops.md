# DevSecOps

Devsecops is a way of thinking about security that emphasizes collaboration between developers and security professionals. The goal of devsecops is to make security an integral part of the software development process, so that security concerns are addressed early and throughout the software development lifecycle.


## Concepts

```{admonition} Why is learning fundamental DevSecOps concepts important?
:class: dropdown
A concept is an abstract idea that represents a general understanding of something. Devsecops concepts are important because they help organizations to better understand how to integrate security into the software development process. By understanding these concepts, organizations can improve their overall security posture and better protect their applications and data.

## Procedures

```{admonition} What is a procedure and a workflow and why are they important in DevSecOps?
:class: dropdown
A procedure is a set of instructions that detail how to carry out a task. We need to master DevSecOps procedures for ensuring the security of software development and operations. DevSecOps procedures help us to ensure that security risks are identified and mitigated early in the development process, and that operations are carried out securely.

## Techniques

```{admonition} Why is learning DevSecOps techniques important?
:class: dropdown
DevSecOps techniques are important for keeping systems secure. They help to identify and fix security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. By automating security testing and monitoring, devsecops can help to ensure that systems are always secure.

## Tools

```{admonition} Why do I need to master DevSecOps tools?
:class: dropdown

DevSecOps tools are important because they help to automate security tasks and improve communication between developers and security teams. By using these tools, organizations can better secure their applications and infrastructure. Additionally, devsecops tools can help to speed up the delivery of new features and updates.
