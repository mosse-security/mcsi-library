## Problem Solving Techniques

Problem solving is the process of identifying and resolving issues or obstacles that are preventing the attainment of a desired goal. In many cases, problem solving involves overcoming challenges or obstacles that are blocking the path to the goal, but it can also involve finding new and creative solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems. There are a variety of different approaches that can be taken when problem solving, and the most effective approach will vary depending on the specific problem that needs to be resolved. In some cases, a simple trial-and-error approach may be all that is needed to find a solution. However, for more complex problems, a more systematic approach may be necessary.
