# Problem Solving

```{admonition} What is problem solving?
:class: dropdown
Problem solving is the most important skills in cybersecurity. Without the ability to identify and solve problems, it would be impossible to protect systems and data from security threats.

Problem solving in cybersecurity requires a combination of technical and non-technical skills. On the technical side, problem solvers must be able to understand and work with complex systems. They must also have a good understanding of security threats and how to defend against them. On the non-technical side, problem solvers must be able to communicate effectively with others and work well in team settings.

The ability to solve problems is critical to the success of any cybersecurity professional.

In this section, we offer some problem solving and structured analytics techniques you are encouraged to learn and master.

## Problem Solving Techniques

Problem solving is the process of identifying and resolving issues or obstacles that are preventing the attainment of a desired goal. In many cases, problem solving involves overcoming challenges or obstacles that are blocking the path to the goal, but it can also involve finding new and creative solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems. There are a variety of different approaches that can be taken when problem solving, and the most effective approach will vary depending on the specific problem that needs to be resolved. In some cases, a simple trial-and-error approach may be all that is needed to find a solution. However, for more complex problems, a more systematic approach may be necessary.

## Root Cause Analysis

Root cause analysis (RCA) is a process used in IT to identify the underlying cause of a problem. By identifying the root cause, IT professionals can develop a solution that addresses the problem at its source, rather than simply treating the symptoms. Root cause analysis typically involves breaking down a problem into smaller pieces and then systematically investigating each piece to identify the root cause. This process can be used to identify problems with hardware, software, processes, or any other aspect of IT.

**When should I used a structured RCA technique?**

There are two main approaches to problem solving: the intuitive approach and the structured approach. The intuitive approach is more flexible and relies on our natural ability to see patterns and relationships. The structured approach is more rigid and relies on a step-by-step process to find a solution. The intuitive approach is often quicker and can be more creative, but it can also be less reliable. The structured approach is usually slower, but it can be more reliable. Which approach is best depends on the problem at hand.

If you encounter an IT issue, such as a software bug, you should first try to resolve it intuitively. However, you should only try this for 20 minutes the first time. If you are unable to resolve the issue in this amount of time, you must switch to a structured approach. It may take 1-3 hours to address a challenging problem using a structured approach. Though these issues are uncommon, a truly challenging situation can take many days to solve. Asking the community for assistance is the next step if structured RCA doesn't work.

**What are the steps in an RCA technique?**

The following diagram shows an overview of the root-cause analysis process:

* <u>Step 1 - Develop an incident statement</u>

When troubleshooting an incident, it is important to first gather all of the relevant information in order to identify the root cause of the problem. This information can be gathered through an incident statement. An incident statement is simply a record of what happened, when it happened, and any relevant details that may help to identify the cause of the problem.

* <u>Step 2 - Identify all of the incident's dimensions</u>

There are many different dimensions to an incident. The most common dimensions are the who, what, when, where, why, and how. These dimensions can help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of an incident.

- Dimension 1: Object affected
- Dimension 2: Type of incident
- Dimension 3: Users impacted
- Dimension 4: Users location
- Dimension 5: Incident location
- Dimension 6: Time and date of the incident
- Dimension 7: Pattern of occurrence
- Dimension 8: Unique attributes

Feel free to add more dimensions. Every incident is unique so you should adapt the process to the problem you are facing.

* <u>Step 3 - Generate hypotheses and test them</u>

When troubleshooting software, it is important to generate hypotheses and test them. This will help to identify the root cause of the problem and find a solution. One way to generate hypotheses is to brainstorm potential causes of the problem. Once you have a list of potential causes, you can then test each one to see if it is the actual cause of the problem. To test a hypothesis, you can try to reproduce the problem and see if the hypothesis is correct. If you are unable to find the root cause of the problem, it may be necessary to ask for help from others who are more experienced.

**Where can I go for help if RCA doesn't work?**

We have found that RCA always succeeds. When it doesn't, it's because the practitioner didn't use the technique correctly or didn't fully comprehend the fault (i.e., it has not been properly dimensioned). In such cases, the following resources will prove helpful:

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) A public platform to ask coding questions
- [Serverfault](https://serverfault.com/) A question and answer site for system and network administrators
- [MCSI Forums](https://mosse-cyber-security-institute.tribe.so/) MCSI's support forums

## Structured Analytics Techniques

Structured analytic techniques (SATs) are a set of tools used by analysts to improve the quality of their analysis and reduce the impact of cognitive biases and errors. SATs are based on the premise that humans are fallible and that our cognitive limitations can lead to errors in analysis. The goal of SATs is to provide a framework for analysis that minimizes the impact of these cognitive biases and errors.
