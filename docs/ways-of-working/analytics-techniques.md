# Analytics Techniques

Structured analytic techniques (SATs) are a set of tools used by analysts to improve the quality of their analysis and reduce the impact of cognitive biases and errors. SATs are based on the premise that humans are fallible and that our cognitive limitations can lead to errors in analysis. The goal of SATs is to provide a framework for analysis that minimizes the impact of these cognitive biases and errors. 

## Decompose and Visualize

The "Decompose and Visualize" approach in Structured Analytics Techniques is a method used for making sense of complex data. It involves breaking down large data sets into smaller parts to make them easier to understand. Once the data is broken down, it is then presented visually using charts, graphs, or maps. This makes it easier to see patterns and trends that might not be obvious in the raw data. In short, this technique helps in understanding complex data more clearly and making better decisions based on that data.

### AIMS (Audience, Issue, Message and Storyline)

The goal of the AIMS framework is to create a structured approach to presenting data that is audience-centric, issue-focused, message-driven, and story-oriented. By following this framework, analysts can ensure that their data presentations are not only informative but also compelling and impactful.

1. **Audience:** The first step is to identify and understand the audience. This involves considering who will be receiving the information and tailoring the analysis to their needs and comprehension level. Knowing the audience helps in determining the complexity of the data, the type of visualizations to use, and the depth of analysis required.

    - Who is my audience? (e.g., executives, technical experts, general public)
    - What are their needs and expectations from this analysis?
    - How familiar are they with the subject matter and technical jargon?
    - What is the best way to present the data to this audience (visuals, text, level of detail)?
    - How can I make the data meaningful and engaging for them?

2. **Issue:** Clearly defining the issue at hand is critical. This involves outlining the specific problem or question that the analysis aims to address. A precise issue guides the entire analytical process, ensuring that the data collected and the analysis performed are relevant and focused.

    - What specific problem or question am I addressing with this analysis?
    - Is the issue clearly defined and understood?
    - How does this issue relate to the interests and needs of the audience?
    - Have I narrowed down the issue enough to be focused but still meaningful?
    - What data is relevant to this issue, and what can be excluded?

3. **Message:** The message is the central insight or conclusion drawn from the data. It should be concise and directly related to the issue. The message is what you want the audience to understand and remember, so it needs to be clearly articulated and emphasized in the presentation.

    - What is the key insight or conclusion I want to communicate?
    - Is my message directly addressing the issue?
    - How can I articulate this message clearly and succinctly?
    - Will the audience understand and remember this message?
    - How does this message drive the desired action or decision-making?

3. **Storyline:** Developing a storyline involves connecting the data points into a coherent narrative. This narrative should logically flow from the introduction of the issue, through the data analysis, to the concluding message. A well-crafted storyline helps in making the data more relatable and engaging, ensuring that the audience can easily follow and understand the significance of the analysis.

    - How can I connect the data points to tell a compelling story?
    - Does the storyline flow logically from the introduction of the issue to the conclusion?
    - How can I make the storyline engaging and relatable for the audience?
    - Are there any gaps or jumps in logic in my storyline?
    - Does the storyline reinforce and support the key message?

### Issue Redefinition

The goal of Issue Redefinition in structured analytics is to explore various reinterpretations of the central issue to understand how these alterations can impact the direction of research. Here is a proposed methodology to effectively experiment with different ways of redefining the issue:

1. **Initial Question:** Start with the original issue or question as it is currently defined. This serves as the baseline for comparison.

    - Have I clearly stated the original issue?
    - Is the original issue based on specific data or assumptions?

2. **Rephrase:** Alter the wording of the issue without changing its fundamental meaning. This can involve using synonyms, changing the sentence structure, or presenting the issue from a different angle. The goal here is to see if a different phrasing offers a new perspective or understanding.

    - Have I tried rephrasing the issue in different ways?
    - Does each rephrased version offer a new perspective?

3. **Ask Why:** Delve into the reasons behind the issue. Asking "Why?" repeatedly helps uncover the root cause or deeper aspects of the problem. This can lead to a more profound understanding of the issueâ€™s underlying factors.

    - Have I asked 'Why' repeatedly to uncover deeper layers of the issue?
    - Are the underlying causes of the issue now more evident?

4. **Broaden the Issue:** Expand the scope of the issue. Consider related areas, wider impacts, or longer-term implications. By broadening the issue, you might identify new areas of interest or recognize broader patterns and trends.

    - Have I considered broader implications and related areas?
    - Does a broader view reveal additional factors or consequences?

5. **Narrow the Focus:** Conversely, make the issue more specific. Focus on a particular aspect, demographic, timeframe, or context. Narrowing down can reveal more detailed insights and offer a more concentrated area for in-depth analysis.

    - Have I identified specific aspects of the issue to focus on?
    - Does narrowing the focus bring more detailed insights?

6. **Opposite Perspective:** Challenge the issue by looking at it from an entirely opposite perspective. This could involve considering the contrary of the current issue or questioning the fundamental assumptions that the issue is based on. This radical approach can sometimes uncover innovative viewpoints or alternative hypotheses.

    - Have I looked at the issue from an opposite or contrary viewpoint?
    - Does this viewpoint challenge existing assumptions or reveal new possibilities?
