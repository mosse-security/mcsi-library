# Analytics Techniques

Structured analytic techniques (SATs) are a set of tools used by analysts to improve the quality of their analysis and reduce the impact of cognitive biases and errors. SATs are based on the premise that humans are fallible and that our cognitive limitations can lead to errors in analysis. The goal of SATs is to provide a framework for analysis that minimizes the impact of these cognitive biases and errors.
