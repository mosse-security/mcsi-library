Cybersecurity is a critical field that demands meticulous attention to detail, especially when it comes to reporting on security incidents, assessments, or compliance. A well-crafted cybersecurity report not only communicates vital information to stakeholders but also serves as a tool for decision-making and strategy development. While the specifics of each report may vary depending on the context, certain foundational principles and guidelines are universally applicable. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these general recommendations, offering a blueprint for creating effective and informative cybersecurity reports. Whether you are reporting on a data breach, system vulnerability, or compliance status, these guidelines will ensure your report is clear, concise, and actionable, catering to all types of cybersecurity reports.

## Step 1 - Stakeholder Analysis

A stakeholder is an individual, group, or organization that has an interest or concern in a particular project, business, or endeavor. Stakeholders are key to the success of a project as they can affect or be affected by the project's outcomes. They can include employees, customers, investors, suppliers, communities, governments, or any entity impacted by the project or business activities. Stakeholders may have a direct or indirect influence on the project, offering insights, resources, or support, and in turn, may benefit from its successful completion. Understanding and managing stakeholder needs and expectations are crucial for the success and sustainability of any project or business.

In cybersecurity, common stakeholders include:

- Cyber Crime Investigators
- Cyber Defense Analysts
- Executive Cyber Leaders
- Forensics Analysts
- Incident Responders
- Information Security Managers
- Security Architects
- and many more

### Identify the Stakeholders

Before you begin writing any report, the first step is to identify all the stakeholders for that report. There are three categories of stakeholders:

```

1. **Decision Makers:** These stakeholders are responsible for making the final decisions on cybersecurity initiatives, policies, and strategies. They may include top executives, such as the CEO, CIO, or CISO, as well as board members who have a direct impact on the direction of an organization's cybersecurity program. Their primary role is to approve and support plans based on input from the other stakeholder groups.

2. **Influencers:** This group consists of individuals who can shape the decision-making process, even though they might not have the authority to make the final call. Influencers can be both internal and external to the organization. Internal influencers may include IT managers, cybersecurity team leads, or legal and compliance personnel, while external influencers might encompass industry experts, regulators, or even key customers. Their opinions, expertise, and guidance can significantly influence the decisions made by the Decision Makers.

3. **Implementers:** Implementers are responsible for putting cybersecurity plans and strategies into action. They play a crucial role in the day-to-day management and execution of cybersecurity initiatives. Implementers can include IT staff, cybersecurity professionals, system administrators, and even employees who follow security best practices in their daily tasks. Their hands-on experience and understanding of technical challenges can provide valuable insights to shape effective cybersecurity measures.

### Map the needs and wants of stakeholders

After determining who the report's stakeholders are, you should analyze each one individually. This has to be completed in a standalone document.

:class: block mb-4 mt-4 mx-auto
```

Refer to the NIST NICE or DCWF framework, which enumerates numerous cyber work roles and the responsibilities associated with each job, if you're unsure about what each stakeholder requires.

### Create a stakeholder checklist

Having identified all stakeholders along with their respective needs and wants, the ensuing task is to construct a comprehensive checklist. This checklist will serve as an essential tool to ensure your report encompasses all necessary elements, addressing each stakeholder's concerns effectively.

1. **Individual Stakeholder Analysis:** Begin by methodically reviewing each stakeholder. Examine their unique perspectives, requirements, and the potential impact the report will have on them. This detailed analysis will aid in understanding the varied expectations and information needs of each stakeholder group.

2. **Categorization and Prioritization:** Group and categorize the key components that are crucial for inclusion in your report. Sort these elements based on their relevance and significance to the different stakeholders. Prioritizing these components will facilitate a structured approach in addressing the most critical aspects of the report first.

3. **Comprehensive Checklist Creation:** With the prioritized elements in hand, construct a detailed checklist. This checklist should be designed as a verification tool to ensure that no critical component is overlooked. It should include specific items tailored to the interests of each stakeholder group, thereby guaranteeing a report that is thorough, relevant, and inclusive of all necessary perspectives.

## Step 2 - Starbursting

Starbursting is a powerful brainstorming technique used to generate questions about a particular subject. In the context of creating a cybersecurity report, it can be an invaluable tool for ensuring thorough analysis and comprehensive coverage. Here’s how to effectively use Starbursting to frame questions for your report:

### Understanding Starbursting
Starbursting involves visualizing a star with the central idea or topic in the middle and questions branching out like rays. Each ray represents a different question or line of inquiry about the central topic. This approach encourages in-depth exploration and uncovers various aspects of the subject that might otherwise be overlooked.

```

### Steps for Implementing Starbursting:

1. **Identify the Central Topic:** Place the main focus of your report at the center of the star. This could be a specific cybersecurity incident, a policy review, or a system assessment.

2. **Generate the Six W's:** Begin by framing questions around the six basic W's: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. For instance:

    - Who was impacted by the security breach?
    - What methods were used in the attack?
    - When was the vulnerability first detected?
    - Where are the gaps in our current security protocols?
    - Why did the incident occur, and what were the contributing factors?
    - How can we improve our defenses against similar threats?

3. **Expand Beyond the Basics:** After covering the fundamental W's, delve deeper. Ask more specific questions that explore each aspect of the central topic. For instance, under "Who", you might ask about the specific departments, external entities, or systems involved.

4. **Organize and Prioritize Questions:** Once a comprehensive set of questions is generated, organize them in a logical sequence. Prioritize the questions based on their relevance and importance to the objectives of your report.

5. **Utilize Questions for Report Structure:** Use these questions to structure your report. Each question can guide a section or part of your analysis, ensuring that your report is well-rounded and addresses all critical aspects of the topic.

5. **Review and Refine:** Finally, review the questions with stakeholders or team members. This can provide additional insights and ensure that the questions are aligned with the goals of the report.

By employing Starbursting, you can systematically dissect your cybersecurity topic, ensuring that your report is comprehensive, thoroughly addresses all pertinent questions, and meets the informational needs of your stakeholders. This technique not only aids in the initial stages of report planning but also enhances the overall quality and depth of your analysis.

## Step 3 - Audience, Issue, Message, Storyline

The AIMS model — Audience, Issue, Message, Storyline — is a framework that can guide the structure and content of your cybersecurity report to ensure it is impactful and understandable. Here's how to use AIMS in greater detail:
