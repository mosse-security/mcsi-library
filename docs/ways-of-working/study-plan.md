There isn't a single best way to learn. To find the approach that works best for you, you might need to test a few methods. In general, the following is what we advise:

- 2 hours of practice per day, 4 days a week
- An afternoon dedicated to working on a harder exercise or personal project
- Reading a cybersecurity book an hour per day
```

The training regime necessary to become a cybersecurity specialist is illustrated in the accompanying image, which offers some helpful insights. Everyone is unique, so there isn't any advice that applies to everyone and always works. However, we advise you to consider if you have been engaging in the proper training to meet your career objectives.

## Start with something that cannot go wrong

We advise you to complete our [MICS](https://www.mosse-institute.com/certifications/mics-introduction-to-cyber-security.html) certification if you are just starting out in cybersecurity.

Then, choose an interest of yours and devote yourself to it. You'll soon see that all cyber domains are interconnected, thus mastering one will help you improve all the others.

## Set measurable goals

Setting goals for learning is an important part of the learning process. By setting goals, you can focus your efforts and stay motivated to achieve your goals. There are a few things to keep in mind when setting goals for learning. First, goals should be specific and measurable. Second, goals should be achievable and realistic. Third, goals should be time-bound, so that you know when you need to achieve them. setting goals for learning can help you to focus you efforts, stay motivated, and achieve you goals.

Here's an example of how to set a goal:

## Write a Learning Journal

A learning journal is a tool that can be used to record and reflect on your learning experiences. It can be used to track your progress, identify areas that need improvement, and set goals for future learning. A learning journal can also be a helpful way to communicate with your instructor about your learning.

We recommend that you create a blog and document your learning journey:

- Write an article every month
- Explain what you've learnt and how it's changed the way you work
- Describe the problems you've faced and how you overcame them
- Attach artefacts that demonstrate your progress

## Inspire others to join you

When it comes to learning, one of the best things you can do is inspire others to join you. When you're passionate about learning and growing, it's contagious. Others will see your enthusiasm and be drawn to your example.

One of the best ways to inspire others to learn is simply by sharing what you're learning with them. When you're excited about a new concept or piece of information, share it with those around you. You never know who you might inspire to start learning themselves.

In addition to sharing what you're learning, you can also encourage others to learn by asking them questions. When you're curious about something, ask others around you if they know anything about it.

- Share your certificates on social media
- Express gratitude towards those who help you
