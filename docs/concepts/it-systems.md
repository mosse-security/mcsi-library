# IT Systems

Information technology systems are integral to the operation of modern businesses. IT systems are used to store, process, and communicate information. They enable businesses to connect with customers and suppliers, share information internally, and automate many processes. IT systems are composed of hardware, software, and networking components. Hardware includes computers, servers, storage devices, and networking equipment. Software includes the operating system, applications, and databases. Networking components connect the hardware and enable communication. IT systems must be designed and configured to meet the specific needs of the business. They must be reliable and secure, and must be able to scale as the business grows.

## Networking

Computer networking is the process of connecting computers and devices together in order to share data and resources. Networks can be small, like a home network, or large, like the Internet. Networks can be wired, wireless, or a combination of both. Networking is a key part of computing, as it allows computers to communicate with each other and share data. For example, if you wanted to share a photo with a friend, you could use a computer network to send it to them. Networks can also be used to share resources, such as printers and scanners, or to give users access to remote data, such as files stored on another computer.

## Cloud Services

Cloud services are a type of internet-based computing that provide shared computer processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. They are sometimes referred to as "on-demand computing" or "utility computing". Cloud services are a way to provide a more flexible and scalable approach to computing than traditional on-premises models. Cloud services are delivered through a network of data centers that are connected to each other through the internet. When a user needs computing resources, they can request them from a cloud service provider. The provider then allocates the resources from their pool of available resources and delivers them to the user over the internet.
