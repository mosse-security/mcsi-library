You won't be able to get the help you need if you can't ask good questions. When asking for help, there is a specific format that the industry wants you to use. You must learn and use this format.

## Guidelines

When asking for help, here's the information that you must specify:

- **Describe the object/thing that has the fault:** What is the most specific 'thing' that you're having a problem with? Be as specific as possible.

- **Describe the fault:** Describe what is wrong with the object. Be as specific as possible. Do you know the cause of this fault?

- **Steps to reproduce the fault:** Include steps to reproduce the fault.

- **What have you tried to resolve it?** Describe what you've attempted by yourself to resolve the fault.

- **Include supporting documentation:** Make sure to include artefacts that can allow other people to help you: screenshot, error messages, URLs etc.
