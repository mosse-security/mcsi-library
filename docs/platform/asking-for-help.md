# Asking for Help

```{admonition} Important
:class: danger dropdown
You won't be able to get the help you need if you can't ask good questions. When asking for help, there is a specific format that the industry wants you to use. You must learn and use this format.
```

## Quick Questions

All of our exercises contain a "Quick Question" section:

```{admonition} How it works
:class: note

- Ask short questions (no more than 200 characters)
- Only ask clarification questions
- For troubleshooting questions, use the [forums](https://mosse-cyber-security-institute.tribe.so/)
- Expect a response within 1 business day
```

## Guidelines

When asking for help, here's the information that you must specify:

- **Describe the object/thing that has the fault:** What is the most specific 'thing' that you're having a problem with? Be as specific as possible.

- **Describe the fault:** Describe what is wrong with the object. Be as specific as possible. Do you know the cause of this fault?

- **Steps to reproduce the fault:** Include steps to reproduce the fault.

- **What have you tried to resolve it?** Describe what you've attempted by yourself to resolve the fault.

- **Include supporting documentation:** Make sure to include artefacts that can allow other people to help you: screenshot, error messages, URLs etc.

## Reporting Bugs

Bugs and errors are an inevitable part of IT. No matter how much testing and debugging is done, there will always be some errors that slip through the cracks!

**Have you found a bug with an exercise?**

You can report a bug with an exercise by clicking the "report issue" button:

<img alt="report bug with exercise" class="mb-3 grey-border" src="/images/platform/report-issue-button.png">

There will be a pop-up box where you may describe the bug. Our team will then receive your message and look into the problem!

**Have you found a bug with the platform?**

You can report a bug in the platform via the "Help" section in the right-hand-side menu.

<img alt="report platform bug" class="mb-3 grey-border" src="/images/platform/report-platform-bug.png">

We will ask you to answer four questions:

1. What is the object or "thing" that you're having a problem with?
2. What is wrong with the object or "thing"? Do you know the cause of this fault?
3. What steps should we follow to reproduce this fault?
