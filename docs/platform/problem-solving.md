# Problem Solving

```{admonition} What is problem solving?
:class: dropdown
Problem solving is the most important skills in cybersecurity. Without the ability to identify and solve problems, it would be impossible to protect systems and data from security threats.

Problem solving in cybersecurity requires a combination of technical and non-technical skills. On the technical side, problem solvers must be able to understand and work with complex systems. They must also have a good understanding of security threats and how to defend against them. On the non-technical side, problem solvers must be able to communicate effectively with others and work well in team settings.

The ability to solve problems is critical to the success of any cybersecurity professional.

In this section, we offer some problem solving and structured analytics techniques you are encouraged to learn and master.

## Problem Solving Techniques

Problem solving is the process of identifying and resolving issues or obstacles that are preventing the attainment of a desired goal. In many cases, problem solving involves overcoming challenges or obstacles that are blocking the path to the goal, but it can also involve finding new and creative solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems. There are a variety of different approaches that can be taken when problem solving, and the most effective approach will vary depending on the specific problem that needs to be resolved. In some cases, a simple trial-and-error approach may be all that is needed to find a solution. However, for more complex problems, a more systematic approach may be necessary.

## Root Cause Analysis

Root cause analysis (RCA) is a process used in IT to identify the underlying cause of a problem. By identifying the root cause, IT professionals can develop a solution that addresses the problem at its source, rather than simply treating the symptoms. Root cause analysis typically involves breaking down a problem into smaller pieces and then systematically investigating each piece to identify the root cause. This process can be used to identify problems with hardware, software, processes, or any other aspect of IT.

**When should I used a structured RCA technique?**

If you encounter an IT issue, such as a software bug, you should first try to resolve it intuitively. However, you should only try this for 20 minutes the first time. If you are unable to resolve the issue in this amount of time, you must switch to a structured approach. It may take 1-3 hours to address a challenging problem using a structured approach. Though these issues are uncommon, a truly challenging situation can take many days to solve. Asking the community for assistance is the next step if structured RCA doesn't work.

## Structured Analytics Techniques

Structured analytic techniques (SATs) are a set of tools used by analysts to improve the quality of their analysis and reduce the impact of cognitive biases and errors. SATs are based on the premise that humans are fallible and that our cognitive limitations can lead to errors in analysis. The goal of SATs is to provide a framework for analysis that minimizes the impact of these cognitive biases and errors.
