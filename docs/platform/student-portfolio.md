# Student Portfolio

MCSI is special because it provides students with an opportunity to develop a portfolio of competencies. This portfolio can be used to demonstrate their abilities to potential employers and to help them advance in their careers. The portfolio can also be used to assess their own progress and identify areas in which they need to continue to develop their skills.

The following image is an [example](https://students.mosse-institute.com/student/9arEjhf18Wdej3PFcVKAaQBWK322) of a portfolio:

## Components

A portfolio contains the following information:

- **Name and online profiles:** The student's name, the city and country where they are from, and any online profile they may have (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn, Github etc.)

- **Points and trophies:** How many exercises, points and trophies the student has accumulated.

- **Certifications and Career Development Milestones:** Which certification course(s) the student is enrolled in and the career development milestones they have reached.

- **Cybersecurity Domains:** This is a completion bar that shows you how many exercises they have completed in a given cyber domain.

- **Techniques and Tools:** This is a completion bar that shows you how many exercises they have completed to master a particular cybersecurity tool or technique.

## Career Development Milestones

MCSI's certifications covers all six levels of the Australian Signals Directorate's Cyber Skills Framework. You will achieve a certificate upon reaching each level.

This example is taken from our penetration testing certification:

### What does each level mean?

- **Level 1) Learner:** You are commencing to learn. MCSI is teaching you fundamental practical skills.

- **Level 2) Novice:** You have now learnt and demonstrated basic practical skills! An industry professional can now give you simple tasks that you can deliver independently.

- **Level 3) Practitioner:** You have now mastered entry-level skills! Employers can allocate you to lead and deliver small projects. You have the skills to act as a junior employee.

- **Level 4) Senior Practitioner:** You have now solved hundreds of hours worth of cyber problems. You can lead moderately complex engagements. At this level, you should consider applying for intermediate roles.

- **Level 5) Expert:** Congratulations! You are now a Subject Matter Expert (SME). At this level, you can solve the vast majority of cyber problems in a domain. You can lead teams and deliver complex engagements.

- **Level 6) Principal Practitioner:** You have gone above and beyond. At this level, you have solved all the practical challenges that MCSI offers. Nothing stands in your way to achieve greatness!

## Demonstrable Artefacts

When students solve MCSI exercises, they produce tangible evidence of their skills and abilities. This allows instructors to gauge each student's progress and identify areas where they need improvement. The artefacts produced by students also provide a valuable resource for future learning and assessment.

Below is an example of a formidable submission by Jeremy that earned him a Platinum Trophy:

The portfolio is a great way to show off your skills and work to potential employers. It is also a great way to get your foot in the door with a company. Many students have been able to get jobs without spending thousands of dollars on certifications. The portfolio is a great tool for students to use to get jobs.

## Trophies

MCSI rewards students with Gold and Platinum trophies to encourage them to produce formidable work. These trophies are a great way to motivate students to do their best and to show off their accomplishments.
