# Student Portfolio

At MCSI, you have the opportunity to develop a portfolio of competencies that can help you demonstrate your abilities to potential employers and advance in your career. This portfolio can also serve as a tool to assess your progress and identify areas in which you need to continue to develop your skills.

The following image is an [example](https://students.mosse-institute.com/student/9arEjhf18Wdej3PFcVKAaQBWK322) of a portfolio:

A portfolio contains the following information:

- **Name and online profiles:** Your name, the city and country you are from, and any online profiles you have (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn, Github, etc.)

- **Points and trophies:** How many exercises, points and trophies you have accumulated.

- **Certifications and Career Development Milestones:** Which certification course(s) you are enrolled in and the career development milestones you have reached.

- **Cybersecurity Domains:** This is a completion bar that shows how many exercises you have completed in a given cyber domain.

- **Techniques and Tools:** This is a completion bar that shows how many exercises you have completed to master a particular cybersecurity tool or technique.

## Career Development Milestones

MCSI's certifications covers all six levels of the Australian Signals Directorate's Cyber Skills Framework. You will achieve a certificate upon reaching each level.

This example is taken from our penetration testing certification:

### What does each level mean?

- **Level 3) Practitioner:** You have now mastered entry-level skills! Employers can allocate you to lead and deliver small projects. You have the skills to act as a junior employee.

- **Level 4) Senior Practitioner:** You have now solved hundreds of hours worth of cyber problems. You can lead moderately complex engagements. At this level, you should consider applying for intermediate roles.

- **Level 5) Expert:** Congratulations! You are now a Subject Matter Expert (SME). At this level, you can solve the vast majority of cyber problems in a domain. You can lead teams and deliver complex engagements.

- **Level 6) Principal Practitioner:** You have gone above and beyond. At this level, you have solved all the practical challenges that MCSI offers. Nothing stands in your way to achieve greatness!
