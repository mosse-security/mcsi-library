# Minimum Requirements

## Training Laptop

Courses can be completed on a standard training laptop. To ensure you have the necessary hardware to complete the course, your machine should meet the following specifications:

- 64-bit Intel i5/i7 2.0+ GHz processor or equivalent
- 8GB of RAM
- Ability to run at least (1) virtual machine using Virtual Box, or an equivalent virtualization software
- Windows 10 or later, macOS 10 or later, or Linux
- Local administrator privileges

**Do you support older operating systems?**

Yes. Many of the exercises can be completed on older OS versions. A few of our students are successfully using older equipment to learn cybersecurity.

## Competencies

In order to learn cybersecurity, a person must first know the basics of IT. This includes understanding how computers and networks work, as well as common security threats and how to protect against them. With this knowledge, a person can then begin to learn more specialized cybersecurity skills, such as penetration testing and incident response.

The minimum technical skills you must have to benefit from our platform include:

- Using command line utilities and tools
- Operating virtual machines
- Installing and managing software in virtual machines
- Troubleshooting and resolving software errors

**What if I'm completely new to Information Technology (IT)?**

We recommend that you complete the following free courses:

- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing) to learn fundamental IT concepts
- [Google IT Certificates](https://grow.google/certificates/it-support/#?modal_active=none) to learn fundamental IT skills for free
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) to learn software programming

## Lab Environment

Our courses teach you how to setup and configure your own cybersecurity lab.

There are numerous advantages to creating your own cybersecurity lab rather than paying for one. The cost savings are perhaps the most evident benefit. When compared to the expense of licensing a pre-built lab, creating your own lab can save you thousands of dollars. You also have the option of customizing the lab environment to meet your specific requirements. You can, for example, select the hardware and software that will be used in your lab.

Another advantage of setting up your own cybersecurity lab is that it allows you to learn new skills. Building a lab from the ground up necessitates knowledge of networking, system administration, and other technical subjects. This experience is invaluable in your career as a cybersecurity professional.

We frequently see students who can complete a task in a pre-built lab but cannot complete the same task at work. This is because these labs are meant to lessen work complexity, thereby creating an illusion of personal capabilities. It's also worth noting that you'll be expected to set up your own lab to test tools and techniques in the workplace. Employers may give you the resources to set up virtual computers and networks, but it will be up to you to manage the lab environment and maintain your tools.

Finally, you should know that pre-built labs are not commonly licensed by top cybersecurity professionals. They've realized that setting up a lab is simple, efficient, adaptable, cost-effective, and that it sparks creativity. It also nullifies risk of performing unauthorized actions against systems provisioned by a third-party.

## Proficiency in the English language

You must have the ability to comfortably read and understand IT documentation written in English. Ideally, they have an IELTS score of 6.5 with no band less than 6 (or equivalent).

*Important: You can register for courses without having undertaken an English test.*
