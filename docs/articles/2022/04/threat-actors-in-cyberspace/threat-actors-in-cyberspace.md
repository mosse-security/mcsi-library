# Threat Actors in Cyberspace

In information security, there are several types of threat actors. Some are motivated by money, others by political or ideological motivations, whereas others by a desire to harm others. The most prevalent sort of threat actor is the profit-driven criminal. There are, however, numerous state-sponsored actors who are frequently driven by political or ideological motivations. These state-sponsored actors may be very dangerous since they have resources that most criminals do not.

## Script Kiddies

_A "script kiddie" is a low-skilled hacker who depends on pre-written programs to accomplish their tasks._

Script Kiddies often lack the technical abilities required to construct their own tools and instead rely on ready-made scripts or programs that may be easily acquired online. While script kiddies are not as harmful as more skilled hackers, they can nevertheless cause substantial harm. Their attacks are mostly opportunistic and they target individuals and organizations that have poor cyber hygiene.

## Hacktivists

_Hacktivists are hackers who use hacking as an instrument to promote political or social causes._

Cyberspace is full of hackers. Hackers come in various types and sizes, but one type stands out above the rest: the hacktivist. They cam be very competent and experienced in a variety of computer-related issues. While some hacktivists participate in unlawful acts such as hacking into government websites or stealing sensitive information, others merely utilize their abilities to raise awareness about topics that are important to them. A hacktivist, for example, may construct a website that exposes government wrongdoing or a video that goes viral and raises awareness of an important social issue.

## Organized Criminals

_Organized criminals are financially motivated professional hackers that perpetrate crimes as a team._

They frequently have links to conventional organized crime, such as the Mafia, and utilize their expertise to enhance these groups' criminal activities. Identity theft, data breaches, ransomware, and extortion are some of the actions that organized crime hackers may participate in. They may not be the most adept hackers, but their ties to organized crime make them a big threat.

## Advanced Persistent Threats

_Advanced persistent threats (APTs) is a loose term that refers to state-sponsored attackers and financially motivated groups that extremely skilled._

These hackers frequently have financial motives and are proficient at covering their tracks. As a result, APTs can remain undetected in a system for months or even years. One of the most difficult parts of combatting APTs is that their strategies are continually growing and adapting. Organizations must be attentive in monitoring their systems for indicators of infiltration, as well as proactive in predicting the next move of these sophisticated adversaries.

APT attacks are notoriously tough to protect against since they are generally well planned and executed. Before starting an assault, attackers would sometimes spend months or even years gathering intelligence about their target.

## Final Words

Organizations can defend against threats by implementing strong security measures. These include things like training employees in cyber security, installing firewalls and antivirus software, and having a policy in place for how to deal with data breaches. By taking these precautions, organizations can make it much harder for attackers to gain access to their systems and steal sensitive information.
