# Stop Cyberattacks Before they Start with an Intrusion Detection System

Malicious or anomalous activities can occur on a system at any time, making the presence of intrusion detection systems critical. The job of an intrusion detection system is to detect suspicious activities, while monitoring a system or network and analyzes data to identify potential incidents. Intrusion detection systems can be host based or network based.

## Host based IDS (HIDS)

A host intrusion detection system (HIDS) is a type of security software that runs on a computer or network server. Its purpose is to monitor host system activity and detect any suspicious or unauthorized activity. A HIDS is typically made up of two parts: a sensor and an analyzer. The sensor is in charge of collecting data about system activity, while the analyzer uses this data to identify any potential security threats.

Host intrusion detection systems typically employ one of two detection methods: signature-based detection or anomaly-based detection. Signature-based detection, also known as rule-based detection, searches for patterns that correspond to known attack signatures. This means that in order for the system to be effective, it must be constantly updated with the most recent signatures. Anomaly detection, on the other hand, seeks deviations from normal behaviour. This method of detection is more effective against zero-day attacks, which have no known signature. Because both signature-based and anomaly-based detection have advantages and disadvantages, it is often preferable to use a hybrid approach that employs both types of detection.

## Network based IDS (NIDS)

A network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) is a system that monitors network traffic for indicators of malicious activity or policy violations. NIDS systems are typically installed at strategic points throughout a network to monitor traffic flowing to and from network devices. To detect malicious activity, NIDS systems employ a variety of techniques, including signature-based detection, anomaly-based detection, and heuristic-based detection.

Signature-based detection looks for traffic that matches known malicious signatures in a database of known malicious signatures. Anomaly-based detection seeks out traffic that deviates from expected patterns of behavior. To identify suspicious traffic, heuristic-based detection employs rules of thumb.

## HIDS VS NIDS

Host-based intrusion detection systems are more effective at detecting attacks that target a specific machine because they have access to all activity on that machine. Because they can see all traffic passing through the network, network-based intrusion detection systems are better at detecting attacks that target the entire network. Which type of intrusion detection system is best depends on the organization's specific needs.

As a result, NIDS can detect an attacker before he can perform a breach, whereas HIDS acts as a second layer of defense, taking action at the endpoint if the system is breached. NIDS provides a quick response because real-time data monitoring can trigger alerts, whereas HIDS examines logged files for signs of malicious activity.

## Final Words

Any business or organization that wants to protect itself from cyberattacks should invest in an intrusion detection system. An intrusion detection system can help you detect and respond to attacks quickly by monitoring network traffic and looking for suspicious activity. However, keep in mind that an intrusion detection system is not a substitute for other security measures such as firewalls and antivirus software. It's only one part of the puzzle.
