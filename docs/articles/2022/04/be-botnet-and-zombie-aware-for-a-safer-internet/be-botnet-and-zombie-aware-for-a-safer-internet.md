# Be Botnet and Zombie Aware for a Safer Internet!

Zombies and botnets are two of the most popular forms of malware used to attack computer systems maliciously. Botnets are virtual networks of zombies created by attackers who use bot programs to remotely control susceptible computers. Botnets can be used to conduct coordinated attacks against other computing resources, such as targeted distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The emergence of bot malware has been distinguished by a shift in motive from curiosity and fame-seeking to illegal financial gain.

## Botnets and Zombies definition

Bot programs (malware) are distributed to users using a variety of methods, including email attachments, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, and visits to an infected website.

Bot malware often takes advantage of system flaws and software faults, as well as hacker-installed backdoors, to install harmful code on computers without the owners' approval or knowledge. They subsequently insert themselves into these computers, usually for malicious motives. Individual machines that have been infected with bot malware are subsequently transformed into zombies. These can subsequently be used as remote attack tools or to join a botnet under the botnet's control.

Zombies are nodes in machines' sleeper cells, waiting for their command and control (C&C) servers to activate them. C&C servers are frequently compromised machines that are placed in a scattered configuration to hinder traceability. Botnet controllers frequently use authentication mechanisms (such as password-based login from a preset domain) on C&C servers to prevent unauthorised third-party access. The botnet controllers can deliver attack directives to the servers via IRC channels or P2P technologies once they have been authenticated and logged in.

## Motivations

Curiosity and a desire for fame have traditionally been the driving forces behind underground research and hacking.
However, recent developments imply that online attackers' goal has switched from curiosity to illegal financial gain.
This is somewhat unsurprising, given how recent advancements in information and communication technology (ICT) and the internet have transformed communication and business (e.g., electronic payment systems and online auction sites).

## Security Countermeasures

There are a variety of methods available to combat zombies and botnets. First and foremost, it is critical to ensure that all devices on a network are adequately secured with security software, such as anti-virus and anti-malware applications. Second, it is critical to maintain all software up to date, as zombies and botnets take use of several security flaws. Finally, it is critical to be aware of the symptoms of a computer infection, such as unusual activity or suspicious messages. If a computer becomes infected, it is critical to remove the virus and protect the system to avoid further infections.

## Final Words

To summarize, botnets and zombies pose a significant threat to internet security. They may be used to launch attacks on unsuspecting victims, causing massive damage. It is critical to be conscious of the risks they bring and to take precautions to avoid them.
