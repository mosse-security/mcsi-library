# Watch out for these Visual Signs of Malware Infection!

There are a few things to check for if you suspect your computer has been infected with malware. To begin, look for any strange or unexpected conduct. If your computer becomes noticeably slower or apps crash for no apparent reason, this might be an indication of infection. Another red flag is the appearance of additional toolbars or icons that you did not install, or if your home page has been modified without your consent. The best thing to do if you suspect malware is to perform a scan using a trusted anti-virus application. This will help in the detection and removal of any dangerous software that may be present on your PC.

**1. Pop-ups and new toolbars**

If you see any pop-ups or new toolbars on your computer, your system may have been infected with malware. Malware is software that is intended to damage your computer or data. It might manifest as viruses, Trojans, spyware, or adware. If you believe that your machine has been compromised with malware, you must act quickly. The longer you delay, the more damage the infection will be able to wreak. The following are some of the most typical signs of a malware infection: - Pop-ups: You may see new windows or advertisements appearing on your screen even while you are not browsing the web. - New toolbars: You may notice new toolbars being launched without your permission or request.

**2. Slow performance**

Your computer may be infected with malware if it is running slowly. Malware includes viruses, spyware, and other potentially destructive applications. Some of the most prevalent signs of malware infection are:

- Malware can slow down your computer, making it difficult to launch and utilize apps.
- Pop-up advertisements: Many malware programs will display pop-up advertisements on your   screen. These advertisements may be both obnoxious and obtrusive.
- Unwanted changes: Malware might alter your browser settings or homepage without your knowledge.
- Unknown programs: Malware can infiltrate your system without your knowing. If you come across apps that you do not recognize, they might be malware.

**3. Changes to websites**

Have you ever noticed suspicious changes to popular websites without your action? It might be an indication that your computer is compromised with malware.Â A change in a login or payment form is one of the most typical indications of malware infection. This is because the virus tries to send you to steal your personal and credit card information.

**4. Suspicious files and folders**

Some cyber criminals use compromised computers to store pirated files. If you happen to browse your folders and come across hundreds of suspicious files then that's a strong indication that your computer is compromised.

## What if there are no signs?

Not all malware generate visual signs of compromise. The only other way to detect an infection is through digital forensics!

## Final Words

If you are encountering any of the above-mentioned malware infection symptoms, you must act quickly. Malware may seriously harm your computer and steal your personal information.
If you suspect your computer has been infected with malware, you may take the following steps to remove the infection and secure your data:

1. Run a malware detection application on your computer.
2. Remove any suspicious files or applications that have been discovered.
3. Change all of your passwords.
4. Run another virus scan on your PC.
5. Keep your anti-malware software up to date.
