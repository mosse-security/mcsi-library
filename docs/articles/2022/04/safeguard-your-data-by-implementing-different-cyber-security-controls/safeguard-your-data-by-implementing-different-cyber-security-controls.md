# Safeguard your Data by Implementing Different Cyber Security Controls

Understanding what cyber risks exist is the first step in preventing them. Cyber threats can take various forms and include any type of threat that uses technology to harm people or organizations. In this article, we introduce three types of security controls that can protect individuals and organizations from cyber attacks.

## Physical controls

Devices or methods that restrict access to systems or data are known as physical controls. You can successfully prevent unauthorized personnel from accessing sensitive information or disrupting operations by physically controlling access to systems and data. Security mechanisms such as locks and access cards are examples of physical controls.

Physical controls can guarantee that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information by preventing unauthorized access to systems and data.

## Technical controls

Technical controls come in a variety of forms, but the most prevalent include firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and network segmentation. These measures, when applied correctly, can successfully mitigate a wide range of cyber risks.

Data encryption is also one of the most important elements you can do to keep your data safe. Be sure to use a strong password that cannot be easily guessed. You should also encrypt any backups of your data, whether they are stored on an external hard drive or in the cloud. Another way to protect your data is to encrypt your email. This will prevent anyone from reading your emails if they intercept them. There are many programs that can do this, such as GPG4Win and Mailvelope. Finally, you should use a password manager to create and store strong passwords for all of your online accounts. Taking these steps will help to ensure that data is safe from cyber criminals.

## Administrative controls

Administrative controls usually include developing policies and procedures, creating user awareness, and training employees. Effective administrative control is one that is well-aligned with the businessâ€™s overall goals and vision. It should also be one that effectively supports the people, processes, and technologies of the business.

For example, a company might develop a policy that requires all employees to use strong passwords. To create user awareness, the company might provide regular training on password security. To ensure that employees follow the policy, the company might require all employees to change their passwords every 90 days.
