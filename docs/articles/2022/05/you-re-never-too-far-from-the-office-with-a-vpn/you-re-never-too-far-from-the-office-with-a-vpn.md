# You're Never Too Far From the Office With a VPN

It is usually suggested to have your own private dedicated line between multiple places for safe connections. However, this approach is quite expensive since various sites must be connected by different cables, and building cables across geographies is an expensive operation. Also, maintenance is another problem. To address these issues, a virtual private network (VPN) was created. In this blog, we will define what a virtual private network is and how the tunneling process works.

## What is a VPN?

A virtual private network expands a private network using a tunneling protocol. It resembles a leased line (which is a dedicated communication channel that links two or more locations), but uses the public network to connect to remote sites.

Virtual private networking is built on tunnels. A virtual private network is so named because it behaves as though it is under private control even if it is not.
A VPN tunnels packets from the company's private network to a remote location using virtual, non-physical connections routed through a public network or the Internet. This implies that the user may benefit from specialized connections without having to maintain all of them.

VPNs are classified into two types:

- site-to-site,
- and remote access.

## What is tunneling?

VPN tunneling is the encapsulation of one data packet within another. A data packet from one protocol is wrapped in another and sent between a VPN client and a server. The protocol you use for tunneling (such as _PPTP_) handles user authentication, data integrity, and data encryption on its own.

Tunneling is the foundation of many security systems. Packets are wrapped in a wrapper that contains network addressing information to build a tunnel. While the wrapper is installed, it manages network navigation. When the wrapper transports the packet on an uncontrolled network, the real packets are securely encoded inside the wrapper. You can remove the wrapper and decrypt the packet within a secure domain.

**tunneling protocols**

Tunneling needs three separate protocols:

- Carrier Protocol: The protocol employed by the network (IP) across which the data is moving.
- Encapsulating protocol: The protocol that surrounds the original data. (PPTP, L2TP, IPSec, Secure Shell).
- Passenger protocol: The original data that is being transported

Will cover tunneling protocols in another blog. Let's continue with benefits of using a virtual private network.

## VPN Advantages

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) enables two computers to securely interact across a public network such as the Internet. This lets workers, partners, and other small branch offices securely and affordably connect to the corporate network. A tiny branch office of a corporation can connect to the main office through a VPN via the Internet and access information on the network as if it were all on the same network.

Some of the benefits of utilizing a VPN include:

**Cost-effective:** Using private networks was formerly the sole option for wide area network connections. However, it was costly and not always viable, difficult to scale, and lacked security measures. A VPN solution that uses the Internet is a low-cost option that takes full advantage of the Internet's cost benefits while also providing a higher degree of security.

**Simple connection:** VPN allows for seamless integration with existing network infrastructure. It is not necessary to modify your network design or any network software components.

**Secure access:** One of the VPN's key goal is to offer remote users access to the organization's trusted network.

**Extranet connection:** Companies must communicate with their external partners in order to provide particular information. As a result, they require a secure connection between the two parties.
VPN systems provide safe communication between two parties, allowing even confidential information to be communicated.

## Conclusion

A virtual private network ensures data privacy, integrity, and authenticity regardless of your location. The majority of organizations have departments in various parts of the world. All of these units must be connected to the main office regardless of where you are.

A properly configured VPN is a great solution to a quick, safe, secure, and trustworthy network that allows distant departments to communicate with all of their offices.
