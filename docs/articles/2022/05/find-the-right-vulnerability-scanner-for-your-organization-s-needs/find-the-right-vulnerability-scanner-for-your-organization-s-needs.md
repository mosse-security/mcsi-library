# Find the Right Vulnerability Scanner for your Organization's Needs
 

A vulnerability assessment is the process of detecting, assessing, and prioritizing vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and applications. A vulnerability assessment's purpose is to offer data that may be utilized to make judgments about where to allocate resources to address vulnerabilities. A vulnerability assessment can be conducted using a variety of approaches, with the most appropriate method depending on the specific system under assessment and the assessment's objectives. In this article let us look at different types of vulnerability assessment tools.

## Active vs. Passive Scanners

Active scanners are tools that perform vulnerability assessment by identifying potential security issues in systems and applications. These scanners can check for a variety of security vulnerabilities, such as weak passwords, unpatched software, and exposed services. Active scanners can assist companies in mitigating risks and improving their overall security posture by spotting potential security concerns. Active scanners are not recommended for use in critical operating systems as they use a considerable amount of system resources to perform the analysis which can impact the performance of the system.

Passive scanners are tools that can be used to assess the vulnerability of a system. They operate by passively observing and analyzing communications for signals of potential vulnerabilities. This makes them excellent for usage in contexts where actively probing the system is neither viable nor desirable, such as production networks.

## Network Security Scanners

A typical network vulnerability assessment tool would first identify the operating system running on a certain host computer and then test it for known vulnerabilities.

A network scanner would also search for common applications and services. One of the most popular and well-known tools is Nmap, which is a network exploration and security auditing tool. Nmap may be used to detect network hosts and services as well as to scan for vulnerable open ports. Nmap is not without limits; it is ineffective at detecting software vulnerabilities and can be slow when scanning big networks.

OpenVAS is another common network vulnerability assessment tool. OpenVAS is a full-featured vulnerability scanner that can detect a wide range of vulnerabilities in software and network infrastructure.

## Application Scanners

Application-layer vulnerability assessment tools are designed to assess the security of applications by identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. These tools can be used to assess the security of web-based applications, mobile applications, and desktop applications. Application-layer vulnerability assessment tools typically work by sending requests to the application and analyzing the responses. The responses are then matched to a database of known vulnerabilities, and any vulnerabilities that match are notified.

Because of the sensitive information they may hold, web-based apps are becoming more common and are frequently the subject of attack. Web-based vulnerability assessment tools are intended to detect flaws that could be exploited by attackers with access to the webserver where the application is hosted. These tools can be used to analyze security by detecting flaws in application code, web server settings, and the underlying operating system.

## Conclusion

There are several types of vulnerability assessment tools available, each with its own set of benefits and drawbacks. The best tool for you will depend on your specific needs and requirements. Some tools are better suited to small firms, while others are better suited to giant corporations. Finally, the best method to locate the proper tool for you is to try a few different ones and see which one works best for you.
