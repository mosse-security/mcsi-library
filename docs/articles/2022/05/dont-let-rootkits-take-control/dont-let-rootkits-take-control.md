A rootkit is a malicious software program that is designed to gain access to a computer system without being detected. Once a rootkit is installed on a system, it can be used to remotely control the system, steal sensitive data, or perform other malicious activities. Rootkits are difficult to detect and remove and can be used to establish a persistent presence on a system.

## Types of rootkits

### Hardware or firmware rootkit

A hardware or firmware rootkit is a type of malicious software that is installed at a low level on a computer system. Because it is deeply embedded in the system's hardware and firmware, this form of rootkit is difficult to detect and remove. These rootkits can give an attacker complete control over the machine. A hardware rootkit is typically installed in a device such as a memory device or a networking device, whereas a firmware rootkit is installed in a computer's BIOS.

### Bootloader rootkit

A bootloader rootkit is a form of rootkit that is installed on the bootloader of a computer. A bootloader is a type of low-level software that is responsible for loading the operating system's kernel and other required files during the boot process.

A bootloader rootkit can be used to hide other malicious programs and files, such as viruses, spyware, and Trojans. It can also be used to turn off security features like antivirus and firewall software. Some bootloader rootkits allow the attacker to take control of the system before the operating system (OS) loads, making it difficult to detect and remove.

### Kernel-mode rootkits

Kernel-mode rootkits are a type of malicious software that operates at the operating system's kernel level. This gives attackers a high degree of control over the system and allows them to perform a variety of malicious activities, such as hiding files, intercepting system calls, and keylogging. Some Kernel-mode rootkits can modify system code in memory, making them difficult to identify and remove.

### Memory rootkit

A memory rootkit is a type of rootkit that hides itself and its operations in a computer's memory. Memory rootkits are difficult to detect and remove because they exist in a computer's memory, which is not typically accessible to security software. Rootkits of this type operate by infiltrating a computer's memory management system and redirecting memory requests to other sections of memory that contain the rootkit's code. Memory rootkits can also intercept and reroute network traffic by breaking into other components of the operating system, such as the network stack.

### Application rootkit

An application rootkit is a type of rootkit that is intended to hide the existence of a specific application on a system. Application rootkits often operate by breaking into the application's process and intercepting the application's system calls. This enables the rootkit to hide the application's files, processes, and other data from the usual view of the system. Rootkits of this type can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Legitimate applications include concealing a program from users who should not have access to it, such as a security or privacy tool. Malicious applications involve concealing malware applications from detection by security software.

## Stuxnet

*Let us now look at one example of Rootkit.*

Stuxnet is a rootkit meant to attack Iran's nuclear infrastructure, namely the Natanz uranium enrichment facility. The malware was originally designed to target the programable logic controllers and was carried through windows computers in search of Siemens Step 7 software, which is software used for automating and monitoring industrial equipment. When the rootkit discovers a computer running the aforementioned software, it begins sending malicious instructions to the equipment and a disguised message to the main controller indicating that everything is normal. The rootkit was eventually adapted to target more vital energy facilities.

## Rootkit prevention methods

There are a few different ways to prevent rootkits from infecting a system. One way is to use a rootkit detector. A rootkit detector is a program that scans a system for signs of a rootkit. If a rootkit is found, the rootkit detector can remove it.

Another way to prevent rootkits is to use a firewall. A firewall can block traffic from known rootkit sites. This can prevent a rootkit from being downloaded and installed on a system. yet another way to prevent rootkits is to keep the operating system and software up to date. This can be done by installing security updates as they become available.

Finally, using a whitelisting solution can also be effective, as this can help to prevent rootkits from being installed in the first place.

## Final words

Rootkits are a serious threat to security and privacy, and they're not going away anytime soon. With that in mind, it's important to be aware of the dangers they pose and to take steps to protect yourself. Keep your software up to date, use strong passwords, and don't click on links or open attachments from unknown senders. If you think you may have been infected with a rootkit, run a scan with a trusted security program and then follow the steps to remove the infection.
