# Secure Peer-to-Peer Networks

Peer-to-peer networks are vulnerable. There are several ways that malicious code can spread from user to user. For example, some P2P networks rely on file-sharing programs called BitTorrent. These programs automatically download new files from other users. If a virus infects the program, it can spread rapidly. How can you defend against malicious content as a P2P user?

## What is a Peer-to-Peer (P2P)

A basic network is built on a client-server architecture, with dedicated servers serving content to consumers. P2P networks, on the other hand, use a design in which each client is a peer and serves every other client on the network.

Although there are also legal and moral purposes, unfortunately, one of the primary motivations for P2P networks is to allow users to exchange copyrighted items illegally.

## Joining a P2P network

To join a P2P network, you must first install a compatible client program on a computer and confirm that the required network ports between the client computer and other P2P hosts are available. P2P networks allow each system to speak with other systems. A firewall rule would be necessary to enable traffic to and from all addresses that present and potential clients may use for this to operate correctly.

P2P networks are also known for the following extra dangers:

- You have limited options in establishing strict network-based Access Control policies in a P2P network.

- Backdoors and viruses exploit P2P networks as a target entry point. The port(s) used by P2P clients to transfer data may contain viruses. Bad actors may also change well-known Backdoor' names with popular file names in order to make them more appealing and to download.

- P2P networks are used as an egress channel for transferring stolen data. There are also viruses designed to use P2P networks as a distribution point. Attackers first acquire access to data before stealing it. As a further step, the attacker moves the stolen data from a client/network to a place under his or her control. P2P networks are ideal channels for transporting data away from a hacked PC.

- Disclosure of information. Some P2P clients, give other peers on the P2P network backdoor file system access. These users may have immediate access to files on your local hard disk. Unintentional information leakage can occur if setup requirements are not strictly followed.

## Safeguarding yourself

You can put in place the following protections to help reduce the risks associated with P2P networks:

- Implement software application limits. You can utilize software restriction rules to prohibit the installation of unlicensed P2P client software.

- Scan any files downloaded from P2P networks for viruses.

- Before running any files obtained from a P2P network, inspect them with an up-to-date antivirus program.

- Apply tight constraints to directories shared by other P2P clients. This will allow you to define and be aware of which file folders are being shared via the P2P network. This will also help you to avoid storing confidential data within them.

## Conclusion

Security may not be a primary concern in your home networks or small enterprises. However, as we have covered, peer-to-peer networks are frequently used to increase data exposure and as an entry point for infections. Now you are aware of the risks and know how to protect yourself.
