# Keep an Eye Out for Keyloggers - They May Be Hiding on Your Device!

A keylogger is a software program that records typewritten keys and keystrokes. They are used to track what a person types on their keyboard, including passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information. Some keyloggers are installed without the person's knowledge, while others are installed with the person's consent. Once installed, the keylogger records all keystrokes and sends them to the person who installed them. Keyloggers can be used for legitimate purposes, such as monitoring employees or children, or for malicious purposes, such as stealing passwords and credit card numbers.

## How does a keylogger work?

A keylogger tool is either software-based or hardware-based with one unified goal of logging the keystroked of the target user. There are a few different ways that keyloggers can work. Some keyloggers are designed to record keystrokes and send them to a remote location, such as an email address or a server. Other keyloggers are designed to save the keystrokes to a local file, which can then be accessed later.

_There are mainly two types of keyloggers, Hardware, and software-based._

## Software keylogger

Software-based keylogger is a computer program that is installed on your system's hard drive. Some of the common software-based keyloggers are:

**API-based keyloggers:**

API-based keyloggers are a type of keylogger that uses application programming interfaces (APIs) to track and record keystrokes. They are typically used by developers to monitor user activity, troubleshoot issues, and track performance. However, they can also be used for malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive information. API-based keyloggers work by hooking into the APIs of the operating system or applications. This allows them to intercept keystrokes as they are typed.

For example, a keylogger could be used to collect keystrokes from a word processing application, a web browser, or even a game. API-based keyloggers are usually installed on a target system without the user's knowledge or consent.

**Kernel-based keyloggers:**

Kernel-based keyloggers are a type of keylogger that operate at the kernel level. This gives them several advantages over other types of keyloggers. Kernel-based keyloggers are much harder to detect since they do not run as a separate process. Additionally, they can hook into the keyboard driver and intercept keystrokes before they are even passed to the application. Kernel-based keyloggers are generally considered to be more sophisticated and difficult to detect than other types of keyloggers. However, they do have some disadvantages, they require administrator privileges to install, which can make them more difficult to use without detection. yet there are some keyloggers designed to make their way into the kernel and gain admin-level permission. Additionally, they are more likely to cause system instability.

## Hardware Keyloggers

Hardware-based keyloggers are devices connected to the victim’s system externally or installed in the built-in hardware of the victim's system. Here are some of the hardware-based keyloggers:

**Keyboard hardware keyloggers:**

Keyboard hardware keyloggers are devices that are installed inside a computer keyboard to secretly record the keystrokes that are typed on the keyboard. This type of keylogger can be either internal or external.

**USB disk-loaded keyloggers:**

USB disk-loaded keyloggers are typically hidden inside of a USB drive, making them difficult to detect. Once inserted into a computer, the keylogger will begin recording all keystrokes made on that computer. The recordings can then be retrieved by removing the USB drive and viewing the recorded data.

## Keylogger prevention measures

Several keylogger prevention measures can be taken to protect oneself from this type of malicious software. Firstly, it is important to ensure that all software on one's computer is up to date, as keyloggers often exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software to gain access to a system. Secondly, it is advisable to use a firewall and antivirus software, as these can help to detect and block keyloggers that attempt to gain access to a computer. Finally, it is important to be aware of the signs that a keylogger may be present on a system, such as unusual activity or strange files, and to take steps to remove the keylogger if it is found.

## Final words

There are a few final takeaways to keep in mind when it comes to keyloggers. First and foremost, they can be used both for good and bad depending on the person using them. Second, they can be extremely hard to detect, so it’s important to be aware of the signs that may indicate their presence on your device.
