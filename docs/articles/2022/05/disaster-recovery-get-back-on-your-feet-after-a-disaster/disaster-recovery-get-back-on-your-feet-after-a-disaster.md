# Disaster Recovery: Get Back on Your Feet After a Disaster

Disaster recovery preserves business continuity and expedites the recovery process when a firm is hit by a natural catastrophe thereby reducing loss. The purpose of disaster recovery is to limit the effect of the incident on the company while maintaining customer service standards.

## What are the five disaster recovery processes?

1. **Prevention:** This step entails taking inventory of all assets possessed by the firm and prioritizing them according to the likelihood of a loss to the company. Adding preventative measures to the asset, such as authentication and authorization. Finally, look at the assets' ideal working circumstances.

2. **Mitigation:** Mitigation is the following phase, which entails devising or developing an acceptable mitigation strategy. Create a team for disaster recovery and assign tasks and duties to guarantee that the mitigation strategies are conducted appropriately.

3. **Preparedness:** This phase of the service restoration process is sometimes overlooked or omitted altogether. Even while it may seem self-evident that you should restore IT services at all company sites, you should first assess the conditions, dangers, and repercussions of the incident before taking
   any action. Keep the above points in mind when you evaluate. This stage should include staff training and sensitization.Which makes them more prepared for any eventuality. The disaster
   recovery team should receive specialized training to restore the company and
   its assets following a disaster.

4. **Response:** key components of any good response plan include:

   - An assessment of the incident and interruptions
   - Identification of the damaged area
   - Clarification of the requirements for infrastructure failure repair and restoration
   - Then identification of the compromised accounts and customers' needs
   - Definition of the necessary resources
   - Assessing which services are available
   - Coordinating the activities of multiple parties
   - Aligning communication needs and medium

## Disaster recovery has two key elements

**1. Recovery Time Objective:** is the maximum acceptable duration that a device, application, system, or network, can be out of service after a malfunction

**2. Recovery Point Objective:** It indicates the point in the past from which you will be able to restore.

## Importance of Disaster Recovery Plan

**1. It ensures cost efficiency:** A well-executed pre-and post-disaster recovery plan saves money and ensures business continuity.

**2. Increase in performance of employees:** Efficient disaster recovery strategy with roles and responsibilities assignment removes redundancy and increases productivity.

**3. Customer retention:** Downtimes and failures put businesses at risk of losing clients. Thanks to disaster recovery planning businesses may retain customers due to good service quality regardless of the circumstances.

**4. Information security:** it provides a secured strategy to protect the organizationâ€™s critical data assets

## The TIERS of Disaster Recovery.

- _Tier O (No offsite data):_ The company in this scenario does not have a business continuity plan in place. There is a lack of documentation and information preservation. As a result, the time it takes to recuperate is unpredictably long.

- _Tier 1( Physical backup with Cold site):_ Physical backup to a cold location is an important process for safeguarding data from loss or damage. It entails regularly saving the system's current
  state to a physical medium, such as tapes or disks offsite.

- _Tier 2 (Physical backup with Hot site):_ A hot-site is a near-identical copy of the original. The hot-site is located somewhere besides the original location. A third party is in charge of maintaining the hot site. In the event of a disaster, the hot spot is frequently employed. Typically, the hot site returns the original site to its pre-disaster form.

- _Tier 3 (Electronic vaulting):_ It uses a dedicated channel to backup important data to a specific server. Used mostly for permanent backup of essential data. Backups can only be performed for selected, critical data.

- _Tier 4 (Point in time recovery):_ This is intended for businesses that require more data integrity and Tier 4 recovery time than lower tiers. Hard drives are one of the solutions. Data is copied back and forth between the direct and indirect sites, with both sites serving as a backup for the other.

- _Tier 5 Two-site commit:_ Continual data transmission between the primary and backup sites

- _Tier 6 Minimal zero data loss:_ Built for data integrity with little or no tolerance for data loss.

- _Tier 7( Recovery Automation):_ This is the pinnacle of all tiers. The subsequent stages are combined with further automation.

In conclusion, a proper and well-laid discovery plan improves efficiency, provides secure standards, and improves organizational throughput.
