# Get a Grip on your Data with Data Governance!

Data Governance involves defining policies that govern how data generated within organizations is managed, accessed, shared, and owned. Governance refers to rules, regulations, and procedures developed to achieve organizational objectives. This type of policy sets out conditions under which organizational processes, functions, and services operate.

- Data governance can protect businesses against fraud, breach of client confidence, violation of federal laws governing customer data and privacy, defamation, or theft of intellectual property, but there is no standard definition globally.

- Data governance can be used strategically inside organizational structures to guarantee that data collected during various phases, particularly those containing vast volumes of personal data and sensitive data such as health, financial, and commercial information, is correctly handled.

- It leads to better analytics and decision-making.

## The Pillars of Data Governance

**1. People:** they ensure roles and responsibilities are properly defined for formalizing accountability on how people define, produce, and use data in their work. It is broadly divided into three organizational levels.

- _Data owners:_ the Data Owner oversees the data in a particular Data Domain. They are in charge of ensuring that information within their Domain is managed across platforms and business lines.

- _Data Stewards:_ are Subject Matter Experts who comprehend and articulate the significance and use of data. They are the governing body that creates policies for most data choices and issues resolutions. They work with the other Stewards around the company as data governance superintendents. In most situations, they represent the Data Owner.

- _Steering Committee:_ the executive leaders of an organization make up the Steering Committee which includes members of the C-Suite. They are frequently in charge of the specific lines of business that make up a Data Domain.

**2. Processes:** this involves the methods for carrying out the key data governance tasks daily. It also covers the processes that need improvement.

**3. Technology:** in data governance, organizations employ certain software and other technologies to perform procedures quickly and effectively.

## Data Governance Strategy

A data governance strategy establishes a framework for connecting data governanceâ€˜s three major pillars people, processes, and technology. It delegates authority and holds individuals responsible for certain data domains, by establishing the organizational data collection and management standards,and creating processes, and documentation structures. A data governance strategy is essentially the work done behind the scenes to establish the overall requirements for how a company will manage data consistently. This comprises:

- Assigning responsibility for the policies and processes implementation
- Creating policies for data exchange and processing
- Creating data naming and storage processes
- Creating measurements to keep data clean and useable.

## What makes up an Effective Data Governance Strategy

**1. Data Availability:** one of the core frameworks of data security is that data should be available when needed.

**2. Data integrity:** it helps by maintaining the integrity and value of analytics. Which requires deleting, updating, or correcting obsolete or irrelevant data.

**3. Data Consistency:** it ensures uniformity in data collected. Data fields are standardized across databases and departments, making data easier to manage and navigate which leads to making better and more consistent decisions.

**4. Data Confidentiality:** companies must define and secure sensitive data across all locations to pass compliance audits. This covers the locations where the companies store, process, and sends data.

## Components of Data Governance:

- **Master Data:** it serves as the single source of truth for all critical data in an organization Master Data is critical for operational, analytical, and governance procedures to keep data accurate and consistent.

- **Metadata:** is data that give details of other data by giving a structured reference that aids in the sorting and identification of the data it describes.

- **Documentation:** documenting data simply means providing enough descriptive information about it so that utilized appropriately by anyone in the future.

- **Data Catalog:** a data catalog is an organized inventory of the company's data assets. It makes use of metadata to assist companies in managing their data. It also aids data professionals in the collection and organization of metadata to aid data detection and governance.

- **Data Glossary:** a data glossary is a compendium of business terminology and its explanations that organizations employ to ensure that while analyzing data, everyone uses the same concepts. A business glossary creates a shared corporate vocabulary that is utilized by everyone in the company.

- **Data Mapping:** It's the first step in making data transfer, integration, and other data easier.This is done through the process of matching fields from one database to another.

Summarily, data governance ensures that information is useable, accessible, and secure. Data governance leads to better data analytics, which leads to better decision-making and operations support.
