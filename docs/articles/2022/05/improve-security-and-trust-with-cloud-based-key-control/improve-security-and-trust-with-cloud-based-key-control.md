# Improve Security and Trust With Cloud-based Key Control

As businesses move more of their data and applications to the cloud, security and trust become even more important considerations. One way to help ensure both security and trust is to use a cloud-based key control system for your business. Key control systems help you track and manage keys and other sensitive items, so you can be sure they are always accounted for. In addition, by using a cloud-based system, you can give authorized users access to the system from anywhere, at any time. This can help improve security and trust among employees, customers, and other stakeholders. Here's a look at how cloud-based key control can benefit your business.

## Key security in the cloud

Here are several things to keep in mind and think about when it comes to key data security in cloud computing:

**Protection Level**

Secret keys are the arithmetic numerical string sequences that enable cryptographic operations. They must be protected to the same degree of control, if not greater, as the data they protect. According to the organization's data security policy, this level of protection is determined by the sensitivity of the data. We must remember that the cryptosystem's power is only valid if keys are not leaked (except for public keys).

A hardware security module (HSM) is a tool used in servers, data transfer, and log files that can securely store and process encryption keys. If correctly implemented, it is significantly more powerful than storing and maintaining keys in software.

**Key Retrieval**

Accessing a specific user's key should be difficult for anybody other than that user. Yet, there are times when an organization has to acquire a user's key without the user's involvement. This might be because the person was dismissed, or misplaced their key. To access the data, you must have the technology and method in place. Typically, this involves a technique that covers multiple people, each possessing only a piece of the key.

**Distribution of Keys**

Key generation for a cryptosystem may be complicated and risky. You need a key management system which needs a secure channel to begin the key creation process. Passing keys out of the band is a time-consuming and costly practice. Furthermore, keys should never be transmitted in cleartext.

**Annulment of a Key**

When a user should not have access to critical content anymore, or when a key is accidentally or illegally exposed, you need a mechanism for suspending the key or that user's capability to use it.

**Key Vaults**

In many circumstances, it is widely preferred to have duplicates of keys kept by a trustworthy entity in a safe environment.

**Key Management Services**

Keys should never be kept alongside the data they are safeguarding. We should not provide physical access to keys to people who do not have permission.

In cloud computing, it is preferable to store the keys somewhere other than the cloud provider's data center.
One option is for you to keep the keys, but this needs a costly and complicated set of infrastructure as well as a competent staff.

## Conclusion

Now you know how to manage your keys on the cloud. This is a practice that, if implemented successfully, increases security and trust in the cloud.
