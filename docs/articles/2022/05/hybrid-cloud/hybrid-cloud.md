# Hybrid Cloud

Any cloud infrastructure architecture that comprises both public and private cloud solutions is referred to as a hybrid cloud. The resources are usually managed as part of a larger infrastructure environment. Based on corporate business and technical policies, apps and data workloads can share resources between public and private cloud deployments, to ensure security, high performance, scalability, low cost and efficiency. Organizations can employ private cloud environments for their IT workloads and supplement the infrastructure with public cloud resources to manage periodic surges in network traffic, which is a popular example of hybrid cloud. Alternatively, you might save money by using the public cloud for non-critical tasks and data while using the private cloud for sensitive data. As a result, access to additional processing capacity is provided as a short-term IT service via a public cloud solution, rather than requiring the high CapEx of a private cloud system. The ecosystem is connected smoothly to enable optimal performance and scalability in response to changing business needs.

## When to use the hybrid cloud

Here are some people that might benefit from a hybrid cloud:

- Organizations that serve a variety of industries must meet a variety of IT security, regulatory, and performance criteria.

- Getting the most out of cloud investments without sacrificing the benefits that public and private cloud solutions may provide.

- Improving the security of existing cloud solutions, such as SaaS services that must be delivered over secure private networks.

- Taking a strategic approach to cloud investments that allows you to switch and tradeoff amongst the finest cloud service delivery models on the market.

## Advantages of hybrid cloud

-	Flexible policy-driven deployment of workloads across public and private infrastructure environments based on security, performance, and cost considerations.

-	Scale with safety in mind. Scalability is achieved in public cloud environments without exposing sensitive IT workloads to security threats.

-	Reliability. Maximum dependability is achieved by distributing services across various data centers, some public and others private.

-	Controlling costs. Improved security posture because sensitive IT workloads are executed on dedicated resources in private clouds, whereas normal workloads are scattered across low-cost public cloud infrastructure as a cost-cutting measure.

## Drawbacks of hybrid cloud
The hybrid cloud has a number of problems, including:

- Price. It's difficult to keep track of when you're switching between public and private, which might lead to unnecessary spending.

- Management. Cloud infrastructure that spans many locations and categories requires strong compatibility and interoperability. This is a drawback of public cloud installations, as enterprises do not have direct control over the infrastructure.

- Complexity has been added. Organizations must run and maintain a growing mix of private and public cloud architecture, which adds to infrastructure complexity.

## Final words

Finally, it's crucial to remember that your problems will persist regardless of the cloud environment you work in. Even if you're buying services from third-parties, you still need to conduct your homework to minimize risk.
This is referred to as a shared cloud responsibility paradigm. Despite the fact that vendors manage the IT infrastructure and have control over factors like flexibility and agility, your company is still responsible for issues as what information on cloud security and encryption is available to whom and planning for disaster recovery.
