# What is a Public Cloud?
 

Cloud computing is a broad word that encompasses a variety of categories, types, and architecture models. This networked computer approach has changed the way we operate, and you're probably already using it. However, cloud computing isn't just one thing...

it's divided into three categories:

- Public cloud refers to cloud computing that is distributed over the internet and used by several organizations; 
- private cloud refers to cloud computing that is dedicated only to your business; and 
- hybrid cloud refers to any environment that combines public and private clouds.

To some extent, most organizations now rely on the public cloud to help them run their operations. The capacity to scale on demand, pay-as-you-go pricing, and access to a large choice of services are all advantages of the public cloud. However, there are risks associated with using the public cloud, which organizations should be aware of before moving any key workloads to the cloud.

## What is the public cloud?

The cloud computing model in which IT services are delivered through the internet is referred to as the public cloud. The public cloud, being the most common cloud computing service model, provides a wide range of solutions and computing resources to meet the rising needs of businesses of all sizes and verticals. 

A public cloud system has the following distinguishing characteristics: 
- High elasticity and scalability 
- A low-cost subscription price

On the public cloud, services may be free, freemium, or subscription-based, with charges based on how much computer power you use. Computing capabilities can range from basic services such as email, apps, and storage to enterprise-grade operating systems and infrastructure settings for software development and testing.

The cloud provider is in charge of creating, managing, and maintaining a pool of computer resources that is shared among various tenants throughout the network.

## When to use the public cloud

These types of environments are best served by the public cloud:
- Predictable computing requirements, such as communication services for a particular number of users 
- Apps and services required for IT and business processes 
- Additional resource requirements to meet fluctuating peak demands
- Test and development environments for software

## Advantages of public cloud

These advantages of using the public cloud are well-liked:
â€¢ There are no capital expenditures. There are no costs associated with deploying and maintaining the IT infrastructure.
- Technical dexterity - High scalability and flexibility to handle fluctuating workloads.
- The emphasis is on business. Because the cloud vendor is in charge of infrastructure management, there is less complexity and reliance on in-house IT skills.
- Affordability - Flexible price choices depending on a variety of service level agreements (SLAs).
- Cost flexibility - Organizations can pursue lean growth strategies and focus their efforts on innovative projects thanks to cost agility.

## Drawbacks of public cloud

There are certain drawbacks to using the public cloud:
- There is a lack of expense control. When used on a wide scale, the total cost of ownership (TCO) can skyrocket, especially for moderate to large businesses.
- A lack of safety. Because public clouds are inherently insecure, they aren't ideal for sensitive mission-critical IT workloads.
- There is very little technical control. Your compliance requirements may not be met if you have little visibility and control over your infrastructure.

## Final words

To summarize, the public cloud is a tremendously powerful tool that businesses of all sizes may employ. Before deciding to use the public cloud, it's critical to understand the repercussions of doing so. If not used properly, the public cloud can be a fantastic advantage for a company, but it can also be a problem.
