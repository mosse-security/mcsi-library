How often do you get annoyed by spyware or adware? If you don't want to be tracked or see ads popping up every time you visit a site, then you should definitely check out these ways to remove them. We will deep dive into spyware and adware in three sections. In this first part of the blog, we will focus on what spyware is and what spyware can do.

## Introduction

Spyware and adware are usually bundled together with free applications, such as games, music players, and video viewers. These programs are designed to trick you into installing additional software. Once installed, they can monitor your Internet usage and send data back to their creators.

They are basically two sorts of applications that may be both annoying and destructive. Both of these methods may be used to gather data about your computer or other material that you do not wish to share with other people. They may also serve as a distribution platform for other dangerous software.

## What is a Spyware?

Spyware is a sort of application that is used to trail your activities and sneak up on your computers. They can scan systems, collect your private information with or without your permission, and transmit collected data to different devices on the public network.
The information acquired might be utilized for a number of objectives, including unethical or illegal ones. Spyware has become such a widespread issue that hundreds of anti-spyware applications have been developed.

**Spyware capabilities**

- Most spyware applications do not include malicious payloads, and their risk rests in the instability and resource consumption they create on compromised computers. There are several sorts of spyware based on their aim, installation technique, collecting strategy, and so forth.

- Some malware can change your home page or divert your browser to websites you did not plan to visit. Some are also used for illegal purposes, capturing passwords and credit card data and transferring them to the author of the spyware.

- You can unintentionally download them from websites or install the spyware willingly, expecting it to be something else. However, people are frequently duped into downloading it. You can download it in the course of downloading another program or by taking advantage of a vulnerability in your search engine.

- Some spyware applications are harmless and even lawful.

- Many spyware applications take the shape of search engine taskbars, and compromised workstations frequently have many spyware applications installed. They are generally tied to your surfing behavior.

- They can create a very high volume of traffic on your computer with constant pop-ups, many of which go to unlawful websites.

In terms of **information collection methods**, they can:

- log and report on website viewing history,
- search for data kept in the deviceâ€™s filing system,
- monitor keystrokes in search of passwords.
