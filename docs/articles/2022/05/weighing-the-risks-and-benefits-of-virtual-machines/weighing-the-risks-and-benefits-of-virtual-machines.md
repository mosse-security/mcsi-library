# Weighing the Risks and Benefits of Virtual Machines

When it comes to virtual machines, one of the biggest security threats is the possibility of data breaches. These can occur when unauthorized users gain access to the system, or when malware is able to infect the system. Additionally, virtual machines can be subject to denial of service attacks, which can prevent authorized users from accessing the system. To help mitigate these risks, it is important to implement security measures such as strong authentication and authorization controls, as well as effective malware detection and prevention.

Most businesses have switched to virtual machines (VMs), which allow them to make better use of physical server capacity. This approach introduces new security risks that must be managed.

- Infected virtual machines: When you install a prebuilt virtual machine, you install everything, including malware. This is especially dangerous in cloud environments, where preconfigured VMs are frequently the quickest way to bring up a standardized instance.

- Failures in isolation: Each virtual machine should be completely isolated from other virtual machines running on the same physical box. Errors in how this isolation is implemented have the potential to expose VM data. These errors can be caused by issues with the underlying operating system or the hypervisor. When VMs with varying levels of trust run on the same physical server, the risks increase.

- Unpatched hypervisors: The virtual environments' hypervisors are not guaranteed to be bug-free. They, like any other software, can have flaws that hackers can exploit. Patching hypervisors is just as important for security as patching operating systems, but many organizations struggle with patch management.

- Incorrect hypervisor configurations: Even hypervisors with all current security patches can pose security risks if configured incorrectly. Hypervisors, in particular, must be protected from unauthorized access via untrusted networks.

- Misconfigured firewalls: If a firewall is configured incorrectly, traffic may be seen by the wrong VM. There is frequently a lack of visibility into VM traffic, making it even more difficult to ensure proper network controls.

- Unprotected offline VM images: When you backup a virtual machine, the image contains all of the data that was in the VM's memory, including sensitive personally identifiable information like social security numbers. Furthermore, because offline VMs are not kept up to date with security patches, they pose risks when they are brought back online.

- Out of control VM sprawl: Virtual machines are frequently used to provide independent development and testing environments because they make it simple to create new servers. Businesses can easily end up with a large number of VMs that cannot be effectively managed, monitored, or maintained.

## Protecting Virtual Machines

The risks introduced by virtual machines can be mitigated by employing appropriate monitoring and management tools, as well as procedures similar to those used to protect physical servers. Management networks and VM networks can be separated. Businesses should exercise caution when integrating third-party hypervisor add-ons into their environments.

Some other steps to be considered are:

- Virtualization software updates must be checked and applied on a weekly basis.
- Virtual machine updates must be checked and updated on a weekly basis.
- When an account is disabled, it must be tracked back to at least two previous image resort points.
- Any previously disabled accounts must be re-enabled if a roll back occurs.
  If a virtual machine is rolled back to fix a corrupt image, all updates must be re-patched to the most recent updates.

## Final words

Finally, while virtual machines have many advantages, they also pose security risks that must be considered. Before deciding whether or not to use virtual machines, businesses must weigh the risks and benefits. However, with the proper security measures in place, virtual machines can be used safely and securely.
