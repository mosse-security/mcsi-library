# Efficiency Meets Flexibility With Cloud Computing
 

Cloud computing has come to be a big topic in the business and tech world in the past few years. Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence via the Internet ("the cloud") in order to provide faster innovation, more flexible resources, and economies of scale.

## How does cloud computing work?

Companies can rent access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider rather than owning their own computing infrastructure or data centers.
One advantage of using cloud computing services is that businesses can avoid the upfront costs and complexity of owning and maintaining their own IT infrastructure by simply paying for what they use, when they use it.

In turn, cloud computing service providers can benefit from significant economies of scale by providing the same services to a diverse set of customers.

## What cloud-computing services are available?

Cloud computing services today cover a wide range of options, from storage, networking, and processing power to natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and standard office applications. Almost any service that does not require you to be physically close to the computer hardware that you are using can now be delivered through the cloud, including quantum computing.

Building the infrastructure to support cloud computing now accounts for a significant portion of total IT spending, while spending on traditional, in-house IT continues to decline as computing workloads continue to migrate to the cloud, whether through public cloud services provided by vendors or private clouds built by enterprises themselves.
Indeed, whether you like it or not, the cloud has won when it comes to enterprise computing platforms.

## The core elements of cloud computing

Cloud computing can be divided into several constituent elements, each focusing on a different part of the technology stack and a different use case. Let's take a closer look at some of the most well-known.

## The benefits of cloud computing

The specific benefits vary depending on the type of cloud service used, but using cloud services means that businesses do not have to purchase or maintain their own computing infrastructure.

No more purchasing servers, updating applications or operating systems, or decommissioning and disposing of obsolete hardware or software because the supplier handles it all. Switching to a cloud provider rather than relying on in-house skills can make sense for commodity applications like email. A company that specializes in running and securing these services is likely to have better skills and more experienced staff than a small business can afford to hire, so cloud services may be able to provide a more secure environment.

Because organizations only pay for the resources they consume, using cloud services allows companies to move faster on projects and test out concepts without lengthy procurement and large upfront costs. This concept of business agility is frequently mentioned as a key benefit by cloud advocates. The ability to spin up new services without the time and effort associated with traditional IT procurement should make it easier to get new applications up and running more quickly. If a new application proves to be extremely popular, the cloud's elasticity makes it easier to scale it up quickly.

If a company has an application that has high usage peaks, such as one that is only used at certain times of the week or year, it may make financial sense to host it in the cloud rather than have dedicated hardware and software laying idle for the majority of the time. Moving to a cloud-hosted application for services like email or CRM could relieve internal IT staff of some of their responsibilities, but if such applications don't provide much competitive advantage, there will be little other impact. Transitioning to a services model shifts spending from capital expenditure (capex) to operational expenditure (opex), which may be advantageous for some businesses.

## Final words

Cloud computing has transformed the way businesses function, allowing them to scale their operations more quickly and efficiently. However, like with any new technology, there are a few obstacles to overcome before businesses can completely benefit from cloud computing. Hopefully, you now have a better grasp of cloud computing and how it might assist your business as a result of this post.
