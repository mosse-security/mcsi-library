# Defining Security Roles and Responsibilities

Security roles and responsibilities are critical to any organization. They ensure that an organization's assets are protected and that its employees are aware of their roles in security. Security roles and responsibilities also help to ensure that an organization's security posture is aligned with its business goals. In this blog post, we will discuss what security roles and responsibilities are and how important they are to the organization.

## Security Roles and Responsibilities

A security role is a function that an individual performs in an organization's overall security implementation and management. Understanding security responsibilities will assist in the establishment of communications and support system inside a company.

Common information security duties of different positions in a company are as follows:

**Senior Management**

Senior executives are decision-makers.The senior management position is given to the person who is ultimately accountable for an organization's security and should be most concerned about asset protection.

The senior manager must approve all policy concerns. Before any activity can be carried out, it must be approved and signed off on by the senior management. There can be no effective security policy unless the top management authorizes and supports it. The senior manager's acceptance of the security policy implies that the organization accepts responsibility for the security that has been established.

The senior manager pays attention and consideration to developing security for an enterprise and will be held responsible for its failure and achievements.

This position is often allocated to security specialists within the business. Common senior management roles are as follows:

- CEO
- Chief Information Officer (CIO): CIO is an executive that manages the enterpriseâ€™s technology and aims to improve the effectiveness with which information is processed and accessed.
- Chief Information Security Officer (CISO): CISO (which is also noted as IT security manager) is an organization's leading information security officer. He or she is responsible for the organization's information security assessment, management, and execution and. A CISO reports to the CIO.

**Security professional**

A security professional is responsible for carrying out senior management directives. The security professional is responsible for security, which includes developing and executing security policies. The function of a security professional is frequently covered by a team that is in charge of creating and executing security solutions in accordance with the authorized security policy. Security professionals are implementers.

Common security professional roles are as follows:

- Team Leader
- Network administrator
- System administrator
- Information security (InfoSec)
- Computer incident response team (CIRT)
- Risk assessment specialists

**Data Owner**

The data owner's job is to categorize data for arrangement and protection. The data owner is usually high-level management who is responsible for information protection.

**Data Custodian**

He or she applies the required security measures as outlined by the security procedures and senior executives. The data custodian undertakes all operations required to guarantee proper data security, as well as to meet the needs and obligations defined by top management. These operations may involve performing and testing backups, confirming data integrity, installing security solutions, and categorizing data storage.

**Data users**

Because everyone in the company is accountable for data security, data users are included in this category as people having an information security function. Any individual who can enter the system is a user. They only have access to the duties required for their job (which is an application of the principle of least privilege). Users are accountable for knowing and sustaining an organization's security policy by adhering to established operational processes and functioning within defined security limitations.

**Auditor**

An auditor is in charge of assessing and confirming that the security policy has been effectively executed and that the resulting security solutions are appropriate. A security professional or a skilled user might be assigned the job of the auditor. The auditor generates compliance and effectiveness reports, which the senior management reviews. Issues detected through these reports are translated into new directives given to security specialists or data custodians by the senior management.

## Conclusion

As we have covered, clearly defined roles and responsibilities are critical in security management. All of these positions play a significant part in a secure environment. We need roles to define, organize, and carry out the activities and actions required to disseminate security policy, standards, and implementation.
