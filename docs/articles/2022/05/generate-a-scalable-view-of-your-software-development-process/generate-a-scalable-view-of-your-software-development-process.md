# Generate a Scalable View of Your Software Development Process

SDLC, or Software Development Life Cycle, is a set of procedures for developing software applications. These steps break the development process down into tasks that can be assigned, completed, and measured.

## What Is the Life Cycle of Software Development?

The Software Development Life Cycle is the process of building software applications using standard business practices. It is usually divided into six to eight steps: planning, requirements, design, build, documentation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Depending on the scope of the project, some project managers will combine, split, or omit steps. These are the essential components for all software development projects.

SDLC is a method for measuring and improving the development process. It enables a fine-grained examination of each stage of the process. As a result, businesses can maximize efficiency at each stage. As computing power grows, so does the demand for software and developers. Companies must cut costs, deliver software faster, and meet or exceed the needs of their customers. SDLC assists in achieving these goals by identifying inefficiencies and higher costs and repairing them so that operations run smoothly.

The Software Development Life Cycle simply describes each task involved in the creation of a software application. This helps to reduce waste and improve the development process's efficiency. Monitoring also ensures that the project remains on track and remains a viable investment for the company.

**1. Planning**

Project leaders evaluate the project terms during the Planning phase. This includes calculating labor and material costs, developing a timetable with specific goals, and forming project teams and a leadership structure.

Stakeholder feedback can also be incorporated into planning. Anyone who stands to benefit from the application is considered a stakeholder. Seek feedback from prospective customers, developers, subject matter experts, and sales representatives.

**2. Define Requirements**

Determining what the application is supposed to do and its requirements is considered part of the planning process. A social media application, for example, would necessitate the ability to connect with a friend. A search feature may be required for an inventory program.

The resources required to build the project are also defined as requirements. A team might, for example, create software to control a custom manufacturing machine. The machine is required for the process.

**3. Prototyping and Design**

The Design phase simulates how a software application will function. Among the design elements are:

- Architecture defines the programming language, industry practices, overall design, and the use of any templates or boilerplate.

- User Interface – Specifies how customers interact with software and how the software responds to input.

- Platforms – The platforms on which the software will run, such as Apple, Android, Windows, Linux, or even gaming consoles.

- Programming – Not just the programming language, but also methods of problem solving and task completion in the application.

- Communications – Specifies how the application will communicate with other assets, such as a central server or other instances of the application.

- Security – Describes the steps taken to secure the application.

**4. Software Creation**

This is the actual program writing. A small project may be written by a single developer, whereas a large project may be divided and worked on by multiple teams. During this phase, use an Access Control or Source Code Management application. These systems aid developers in tracking code changes. They also help to ensure that different team projects are compatible and that target goals are met.

**5. Testing**

It is critical to test an application before releasing it to users. Much of the testing, such as security testing, can be automated. Other testing can only be done in a specific environment; for complex deployments, consider creating a simulated production environment. Each function should be tested to ensure that it works properly.

Different parts of the application should also be tested to ensure that they work together seamlessly—performance testing, to eliminate any hangs or lags in processing. The testing phase aids in reducing the number of bugs and glitches encountered by users. This results in increased user satisfaction and increased usage.

**6. Deployment**

The application is made available to users during the deployment phase. Many businesses prefer to automate the deployment process. This can be as straightforward as a payment portal and a download link on the company's website. It could also be the installation of an app on a smartphone.

**7. Operations and maintenance**

The development cycle is nearly complete at this point. The application has been completed and is being used in the field. However, the phase of operation and maintenance is still important. Users discover bugs that were not discovered during testing during this phase. These errors must be resolved, which may result in new development cycles.

Models such as Iterative development plan additional features in future releases in addition to bug fixes. A new Development Cycle can be launched for each new release.

## Final words

SDLC demonstrates what is going on and where your development process can be improved.

SDLC, like many business processes, seeks to analyze and improve the software development process. It generates a scalable view of the project, from day-to-day coding to production date management.
