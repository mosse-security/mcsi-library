# Data Loss Prevention: Keep your Data Safe - Part 2

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is a security mechanism that detects sensitive data and alerts administrators when it leaves the network or is accessed without authorization. Endpoint security, email, cloud-based solutions, and mobile device management software are all examples of DLP products. DLP deployments may be viewed as a barrier or a delay in some workers' and departments' day-to-day job tasks and obligations. However, when properly configured, a DLP system may be a valuable asset to a corporation, supporting a variety of security goals and compliance.
The danger of data loss (both customer and company) rises when organizations change their working environments and support their IT infrastructure with the introduction of new and innovative technology.

Removable media such as USB drives, CD-ROMs, mobile phones, and smart watches can be used to retrieve data from a network. As a result, procedures are essential to reduce these risks. Recent cases of data being downloaded from a network without authorization have resulted in a catastrophic data breach.

Not all of these categories of risk can be reduced only through the use of DLP solutions. However, with user education, well-written business rules, a strong network security posture, and knowledge of the laws and regulations that govern the information held, the vast majority of data leaks are preventable.

## Forms of DLP

There are several forms of data loss prevention, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. The most prevalent kinds are as follows:

**Hardware-based data loss prevention:**

This method of data loss prevention prevents data loss by utilizing physical devices. Hardware-based data loss prevention devices can be used to prevent data from being transferred to external storage devices, among other things.

**Software-based data loss prevention:**

In this sort of data loss prevention, to prevent data lose in used the software. Data loss prevention software can be used to encrypt data, prohibit particular file types from being duplicated, and more.

**Cloud-based data loss prevention:**

Data loss prevention (DLP) in the cloud is a security solution that helps organizations avoid losing or leaking important data. It works by detecting and protecting data that is at risk of being lost or leaked, as well as providing controls to prevent unwanted data access.

## Physical Data Loss Prevention

The practice of ensuring that sensitive data is not lost by physical means is known as physical data loss prevention (DLP). This can involve preventing data loss due to hardware destruction, data leaks, or theft. Data encryption, access control, and physical security measures are some of the ways DLP can be implemented. The technique of changing data so that it is unreadable by unauthorized individuals is known as data encryption. Software or hardware-based encryption techniques can be used to accomplish this. Only authorized persons should have access to sensitive data, therefore access control measures can be implemented.

## Technical Data Loss Prevention

Technical data loss prevention (DLP) tools are intended to assist organizations in preventing unauthorized access to and theft of sensitive data. Data encryption, data masking, and data activity monitoring are common characteristics of DLP solutions. DLP technologies include data encryption as a standard feature. Data encryption encrypts data so that only authorized users may read it. Another important characteristic of DLP technologies is data masking. Data masking replaces sensitive data with fictional data, rendering the original data unidentifiable.

## Organizational Data Loss Prevention

Data loss prevention (DLP) is a term that refers to the processes and technologies that are used to protect sensitive data from being lost or stolen within an organization. Data loss prevention is often a high issue in the business world, as the loss of sensitive data can result in financial losses, a damaged brand, and legal fines. Because data can be lost or stolen in a variety of ways, data loss prevention solutions for organizations must be comprehensive and ever-evolving. Data encryption, data masking, access restriction, and activity monitoring are all common data loss prevention measures. The process of converting readable data into an unreadable format using a key or algorithm is known as data encryption. Unauthorized individuals will have a considerably harder time accessing the data as a result of this.

## Final Words

Data loss prevention is a process, not a product. The most important part of any data loss prevention program is the people who design and implement it. The technology is important, but it's the people who have to use it every day who will make it successful.
