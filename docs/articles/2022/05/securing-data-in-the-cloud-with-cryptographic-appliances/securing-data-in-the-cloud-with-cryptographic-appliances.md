# Securing Data in the Cloud with Cryptographic Appliances

Data security is a top priority for businesses of all sizes. But with the increasing use of cloud services, it can be difficult to know how to best protect your data. One solution is to use cryptographic appliances. In this blog post, we'll take a look at  various forms of encryption and how they can help you secure your data in the cloud. 

## Cryptographic mechanisms utilized in data security

Data is often encrypted at rest or in transit, and both forms of encryption must be employed successfully.

**Encrypting data at rest**: Data at rest, either in short or long storage durations, should be safeguarded against multi-tiered issues. Encrypting data at rest is an excellent solution to avoid illegal data access.

Data held in a shared distribution system introduces a danger that did not previously exist; a federal or legal authority may take a specific hardware component while analyzing one client and end up with data pertaining to other customers. If each client uses its own encryption, they should be safe from data exposure during an examination.

**Encrypting data in transit**: To protect against middlemen, you should encrypt data in transit. You should also be aware of the following encryption technologies:

**Transport Layer Protection (TLS)**: TLS guarantees application confidentiality when interacting.

**Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**: It was developed and used by Netscape to cipher the exchange of data between servers, and clients. It was obsolete in 2015 and substituted by TLS. However, SSL is still widely used in many companies because of its ease of use, and updating or transferring could be expensive and cumbersome.

**Full Disk Encryption (FDE)**: You can also encrypt the entire instance. This is the notion of encrypting all your system's data in a single step. Instead of using predefined folders for encrypted content, the entire storage device is encrypted. With the emergence of stronger and faster CPUs, even a small intelligent piece of technology may be completely secured without affecting performance much. Full-disk encryption safeguards data on the machine if it is stolen or lost.

**Volume Encryption**: Volume encryption, like encrypting a whole device, refers to encrypting just a partition on a hard drive rather than the complete disk. This is handy because the whole disk does not have to be encrypted since just the protected parts contain valuable information. Clients may add an extra degree of security by encrypting certain files or folders. In this approach, the client retains the keys to decrypt the data in the event that the drive or partition is compromised in some way.

Take into account that the secure storage and administration of the keys used to encrypt and decrypt is essential for safeguarding any encryption system.

## Summary

Encrypting data at rest or in transit is a good way to prevent unauthorized data access. In this blog, we learned the importance of encrypting your data in transit to defend against person-in-the-middle attacks and the encryption technologies such as Transport Layer Protection (TLS), and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

We also discussed entire disk encryption, which encrypts all of your system's data in a single process. Finally, we discovered that you also have the option of encrypting just a partition on a hard drive rather than the entire disk.
