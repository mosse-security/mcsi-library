# What are software backdoors?

Some of the most dominant risks to systems are in the form of malicious software, which is also known as malware. Attackers meticulously construct, write, and build malware programs to breach security and/or cause damage. These programs are designed to be self-contained and do not necessarily require user involvement or the presence of the attacker to execute their damage. In this blog post, we are going to give an introduction to what is software backdoor, possible ways of getting them into our environment, its nature and scope, and some recommendations on how to prevent from them.

## What is backdoor

A backdoor, is a piece of malicious code (malware) that penetrates a system or network disguised as another program. The harmful application is concealed, and when you activate it, it may truly destroy your system.

A backdoor malware has two main purposes.

The first is to install itself on the computer without the user's knowledge or consent. The second is to perform some action, such as collecting information, deleting files, or creating new accounts with administrator privileges.

## How do attackers install backdoors on systems?

A backdoor can be delivered in many forms. Here are a few examples as follows:

- A backdoor can be supplied in the form of an attachment
- It can be disguised as part of an installation kit
- You can also get a backdoor with an e-mail attachment that pretends to perform something well
- You may catch backdoors via software you share and download from the Internet
- They can give some games simple but effective names
- They can use executable wrappers
- They can assault software distribution sites
- Attackers can exploit source code
- They can hijack the software installed on your system and so on

Remember the attacker's main objective is to hide their evil program in a way that users and applications do not recognize the attacker's main intention.

## Features of a backdoor malware

- During installation, the backdoor may install a backdoor or substitute legitimate software. It would then carry out its task while disguising itself as a different piece of application. Backdoors can be used to undermine the security of your system and can remain unnoticed on your system for years.

- It can employ remote control software. When you run this file, anyone who uses the backdoor as a remote person can now access your machine.

- It may allow the attacker to download files from your machine.

## How to prevent backdoor

There are many ways that you can protect yourself from backdoor malware - some of them are common sense suggestions like running anti-virus software and not opening emails from unknown sources, avoiding downloading any files from unknown sources.

- The easiest way to avoid backdoors is to not let them into your system.

- Back up your data both before and after installing a new software package or operating system!

- A port scan may imply the existence of a backdoor on your machine. If a program opens a TCP or UDP port that isn't often used on your network, you should be aware and take remedial action.

- You can benefit from some tools in the market to determine unusual port use linked with backdoors on your system and distinguish between a legitimate operation and a backdoor.

- You can prevent executable email attachments in your e-mail provider settings.

- As a general practice, harden your system by securely installing security patches on time.

- Use antivirus software to monitor external storage devices.

- You might check file integrity to look for changes to essential system files and registry keys on your Windows computers.
