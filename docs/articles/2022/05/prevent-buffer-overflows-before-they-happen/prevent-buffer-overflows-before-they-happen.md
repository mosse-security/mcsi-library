# Prevent Buffer Overflows Before they Happen
 

A buffer overflow is a type of computer security vulnerability that occurs when data is stored in a memory buffer that exceeds the capacity of the buffer. This can result in data corruption or the execution of malicious code. Programming errors are frequently the source of buffer overflow vulnerabilities. A programmer, for example, may fail to check the size of a user's input before storing it in a buffer. If the input exceeds the buffer size, the excess data will overflow into adjacent memory locations. Buffer overflow attacks take advantage of these flaws by supplying input that is larger than the intended buffer. In the case of malicious input, this can cause the program to crash or allow the attacker to execute code on the target system.

## How does buffer overflow happen?

Buffer overflow is a type of security flaw that can occur in computer code. It occurs when a program attempts to write more data to a buffer than the buffer can hold. This can either cause the program to crash or allow an attacker to take control of the program. Buffer overflow flaws are most commonly found in C and C++ code. This is because these languages do not automatically verify that data written to a buffer is within its bounds. As a result, it is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that data is not written outside the bounds of a buffer. Unfortunately, this is frequently overlooked, resulting in code prone to buffer overflow. 

## Examples of buffer overflow

Buffer overflows are a major security concern that can be difficult to detect and resolve. Attackers frequently use them to gain access to systems or to execute malicious code. Buffer overflows are classified into two types:

1. Stack-based buffer overflows 
2. Heap-based buffer overflows. 

The most common type of buffer overflow is a stack-based buffer overflow.

Heap is a hierarchical data structure, whereas Stack is a linear data structure. Stack memory is never fragmented, whereas heap memory can become fragmented as memory blocks are allocated and then freed. Stack only allows you to access local variables, whereas Heap allows you to access variables globally.

The primary distinction between stack memory and heap memory is that the stack stores the order of method execution and local variables, whereas the heap memory stores objects and uses dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

Stack overflows corrupt stack memory. This has an impact on the values of local variables, function arguments, and return addresses. Heap overflows, on the other hand, are overflows that corrupt memory on the heap.

Finally, buffer overflow attacks can be extremely dangerous and difficult to detect. However, you can help protect your systems and data by understanding how they work and taking preventative measures.	
 
## How to prevent buffer overflow?

It is unquestionably useful to be able to detect buffer overflow vulnerabilities in source code. However, eliminating them from a code base necessitates consistent detection as well as familiarity with secure buffer handling practices. The simplest way to avoid these vulnerabilities is to use a language that does not support them. C allows these vulnerabilities due to direct memory access and a lack of strong object typing. Languages that do not share these characteristics are usually immune. Other languages and platforms, such as Java, Python, and.NET, do not require any special checks or changes to mitigate overflow vulnerabilities.

## Final Words

Finally, buffer overflow attacks can be extremely dangerous and difficult to detect. However, you can help protect your systems and data by understanding how they work and taking preventative measures.
