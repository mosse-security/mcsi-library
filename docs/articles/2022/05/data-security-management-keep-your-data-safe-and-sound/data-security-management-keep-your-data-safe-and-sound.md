# Data Security Management: Keep your Data Safe and Sound

Data security management is a process that provides an organization with an effective means to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its data. It aims to ensure that information systems are designed, operated, and monitored in a way that protects the privacy rights and safety of individuals who use or access them. For Data Security Management to be successful, it must be integrated into all aspects of organizational governance.

## Importance of Data Security

- It assures the implementation of technologies that increase the companies' visibility into where and how their critical data is stored and used.

- Data security solutions use a variety of security measures to deliver centralized reporting, which simplifies audits and compliance requirements.

### Types of Data Security

**1. Data encryption** is the process of converting plaintext into an unintelligible form known as encryption. There are two types of Data Encryption:

- Symmetric Data Encryption: Symmetric data encryption is a widely used cryptographic approach that encrypts and decrypts data with the same key. It's a good technique to keep information safe against illegal access while still preserving its confidentiality. Email and file sharing are two examples of applications that use symmetric data encryption.
- Asymmetric Data Encryption: Asymmetric encryption uses two different keys to encrypt and decrypt data. The public key encrypts information, whereas the private key decrypts it.

**2. Data masking** is the technique of concealing or obscuring data by deleting it entirely or changing its form so that it is no longer discernible. Data masking techniques prevent unauthorized parties from accessing personal and proprietary information.

**3. Tokenization** is the division of digital information into discrete chunks or tokens. These tokens can be copied numerous times without jeopardizing the data's integrity or security. This is beneficial because it prevents data from being tampered with or destroyed.

**4. Data Erasure** is the act of physically or electronically removing data from a storage device, system, or database. Data erasure can be done to protect information and privacy, comply with regulatory requirements such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), protect intellectual property rights, and restrict access to copyrighted materials.

### Components of Data Security

Data security is composed of three main components:

- _Confidentiality:_ Only authorized users should have access to data. If data is not managed appropriately, data security may be compromised.

- _Integrity:_ The term "data integrity" relates to how credible data is. It safeguards the quality of the data. Checksums are one way to assure data integrity.

- _Availability:_ Data should be accessible to authorized users anytime and whenever they need it. Software and DDOS prevention solutions are examples of measures to ensure data availability.

## Recommendations

- **Data Back-up:** Data backup is a practice that you should constantly consider for safeguarding your information. You may generate a full and detailed backup of your data by employing the right backup strategy. Furthermore, the backup software will allow you to restore your data fast and efficiently if the need arises.
- **Password Protection:** Passwords are your computer's and personal information's first layer of protection against unwanted access. Adhere strictly to password best practices.
- **Identity and access management:** The method of managing identities and authentication credentials to secure vital data from unwanted access is known as identity and access management. It includes activities such as identification, verification, authorization, and accounting for who has access to what resources using secure methods. Identity theft, phishing scams (impersonation of legitimate websites), and other attacks that compromise usersâ€™ personal information are all examples of identity-related threats faced by organizations today. Organizations must design an effective IAM strategy if they want to guard against these security risks while still providing their employees with the necessary tools needed for their jobs.
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention System:** Intrusion detection is the practice of constantly assessing and monitoring data on the network for indications of new security vulnerabilities, breaches, or threats. The technique of detecting and blocking intrusions is known as intrusion prevention.
- **Application update and patching:** A patch is a software update that fixes defects (errors) or vulnerabilities in an existing application or operating system. While Update is a more substantial addition of software features (such as a better user interface), as well as performance improvements and bug fixes. Patching and system updates regularly improve data security.
- **Employee sensitization:** Most attacks target employees. Employee education is critical to ensuring data security. Every company should have data security training workshops, seminars, and programs in place.
