# SIM Cloning What is it
 
SIM cloning simply involves making a copy of the original SIM from it. It resembles switching SIM cards. Software is utilized to duplicate the genuine SIM card in this technically complex process. The International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), is used to identify and authenticate subscribers on mobile telephony, and the encryption key of the victim is accessed. The fraudster may take control and use the mobile number to track, monitor, listen to calls, place calls, and send messages by cloning the SIM. 

## How does SIM cloning affect you and why do scammers use it?

By monitoring victims' mobile phones, listening to their calls, following their locations, getting access to their personal and financial accounts, etc., SIM cloning allows the fraudster to run the victims' mobile devices covertly. By dialing or texting using the victim's phone, the fraudster might call or text pretending to be the user. Due to SIM cloning and access to incoming messages, the two-factor authentication technique will allow the fraudster to change the passwords for the victim's account. With access to the victim's passwords, PIN, OTP, and other information, the fraudster may quickly breach the victim's personal and financial accounts and use them for extortion, blackmail, etc.,   

## How is SIM cloning performed?

When a victim is the target of a SIM cloning attack, the scammer obtains physical access to the victim's SIM card and then utilizes smart card copying software to make a replica of the original SIM. They gain access to the SIM card's IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) number during the procedure. They could also use over-the-air (OTA) connectivity to hack devices remotely by decrypting updates delivered to SIM cards through SMS.

The following is the typical procedure that scammers use to copy a SIM card:
- **Step 1:** Copying the original SIM using software
- **Step 2:** Ask the victim to reset their phone when you speak with them.
- **Step 3:**  Take over the steering wheel

## How can you tell if your SIM has been cloned or what are the signs?

- The victim won't be able to use their cellphone number to send or receive SMS messages or calls.
- When you look at the calls and mobile bill statement for your phone, you can see calls being placed to unknown numbers.
- You get text messages telling you to reset your phone from the service provider.
- When you follow the position of your mobile device using programs like Find my iPhone or Google discover my device, you might be able to find it somewhere else.
- Your bank statements may reveal unforeseen expenses.
- You could find that your passwords have been altered, making it impossible for you to get into your accounts. This is feasible because the fraudster may access and modify your PINs or passwords using the two-factor authentication mechanism after he has control of your SIM through SIM cloning.

## What should you do if you believe you are a victim of SIM cloning or swapping?

- If you discover that your cell number has been inactive or out of range for a considerable amount of time, you should immediately contact the service provider. With a new password, reclaim control of your cellphone number.
- Double-check, modify or reset the passwords and PINs for your social media and critical financial accounts.
- Look over your bank, credit/debit card, payment app, and other financial accounts' statements for any unauthorized charges or adjustments. Any modifications or charges should be reported right away to the appropriate authorities.
- In the event of SIM fraud, get in touch with phone banking at once to freeze your account and stop future fraud. After putting the appropriate justification on your identity documents and signing them, submit them to obtain a new SIM.
- Check your personal and social media accounts for any posts or activity that is approved. Take remedial action if you see any such posts, and notify the social media assistance center to reclaim control of the compromised account
