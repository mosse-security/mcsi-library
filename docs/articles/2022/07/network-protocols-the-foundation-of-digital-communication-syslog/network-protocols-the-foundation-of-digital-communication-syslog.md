# Introduction to Syslog

The System Logging Protocol (Syslog) is a standard message format that network devices can use to interact with a logging server. It was created primarily to make network device monitoring simple. A Syslog agent may be used by devices to send out notification messages under a variety of scenarios. These log messages contain a timestamp, a severity rating, a device ID (including IP address), and event-specific information. Despite its flaws, the Syslog protocol is extensively used because it is easy to develop and very open-ended, allowing for a variety of proprietary implementations and hence the ability to monitor practically any connected device. Syslog is compatible with all Unix, Linux, and other \*nix operating systems, as well as MacOS. Although Windows-based servers do not natively support Syslog, various third-party applications are available to allow Windows devices to connect with a Syslog server.

## The Importance of Logging

The log server can monitor a large number of syslog events via log files, which is a significant benefit of syslog. Many printers and other devices, as well as routers, switches, firewalls, and servers, can create log messages.
The syslog server receives, categorizes, and archives log messages for analysis, providing a complete picture of what is happening throughout the network. Without this perspective, gadgets might malfunction suddenly, and disruptions can be difficult to track down.

## Syslog Messages

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port 514 is used to send Syslog messages. Because UDP is a connectionless protocol, messages are not acknowledged or guaranteed to arrive. This can be a disadvantage, but it also keeps the system basic and easy to handle.
Syslog messages are frequently in human-readable format, although they are not required to be. Each message has a priority level in its header, which is a mix of a code for the device's process and a severity level.

## Collecting and Managing Data

A big database is required for a Syslog server due to the massive quantity of Syslog data generated by keeping all of these messages. It also requires administration and filtering software that allows the server to create warnings, alarms, and notifications automatically. Filtering enables a system administrator to readily retrieve files from a certain source, such as a firewall, for a particular time period.

On-screen popups or remote text messages can alert an administrator to any deviation from usual operation. If a specific device causes worry, thresholds can be lowered lower to more closely monitor messages of lesser severity.

## How Syslog Differs From SNMP

SNMP is best suited for confined circumstances with predictable conditions, whereas Syslog is both larger in scale and less constrained in format, covering a wide range of events.

There are also rsyslog and syslog-ng in addition to Syslog. The original Syslog, dates back to the early 1980s, while the other two are somewhat different tastes that have appeared subsequently.

Syslog-ng, which was started in 1988, includes several filtering and encrypting functions. Because its syntax is not directly derived from syslog, a syslog-ng server and syslog-ng configuration differ slightly.

Rsyslog was created in 2004 and is directly developed from Syslog, thus it may be simply utilized as a substitute since a rsyslog.conf file can be replaced by syslog.conf. It also has increased ability to parse unstructured data and transport it to numerous destinations, similar to syslog-ng. In addition to UDP, syslog-ng and rsyslog may employ TCP, TLS, and RELP.
