# Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension SMIME
Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (S/MIME) is an industry standard for email encryption and signing that is commonly used by organizations to improve email security. Most corporate email clients support S/MIME.
S/MIME encrypts and digitally signs emails to confirm that they are verified and that their contents have not been changed in any manner.

## How does S/MIME function?

It functions similarly to a Passport. It has all of the information, almost like a personal Passport. For example, your passport contains information such as your name, date of birth, address, etc. Similarly, a S/MIME certificate is a sort of identity provider that contains information.

If you need to apply for a passport, you must provide papers, such as your birth certificate, driver's license, PAN information, etc., as confirmation of your identity and address. An individual passport is then issued by the issuing authority following the verification of the supplied documentation.

Similar to this, the company must first submit a request along with the necessary supporting documentation to obtain the S/MIME certificate. The Issuing Authority then delivers the certificate and the public key needed to access it when it has been confirmed. Therefore, identical to a passport, this S/MIME certificate is something specific to the user, establishes the user's identity, and includes a public key.

Every time a user sends an email, the recipient will be able to verify that the email actually came from the verified user and wasn't a phishing email from someone using a false identity. As a result, the recipient will be certain that the email was sent by a real person.

## The Value of S/MIME for a Business

In theory, sending an email without S/MIME is acceptable. However, certain benefits will provide your business with the amount of security necessary when delivering confidential or highly sensitive data that you never want to fall into the hands of those with malicious intentions.

### Provides Authentic Identification

S/MIME will authenticate your identity by adding an additional layer of identification, which will include the name of the Authority that has verified the User and validated you as a real sender. If someone impersonates you, the receiver can recognize the S/MIME and the email might be marked as Fake or Fraud.

### Avoid MITM Attacks

If you do not use an encrypted protocol, your email might be the target of data theft, often known as Man in the Middle attacks. If there are any critical details in the Mail, they might be readily leaked or intercepted if it is not encrypted. However, if S/MIME is used, the attackers must decode the message before they can utilize the stolen data. This reduces risk by allowing time to detect the interception and take preventative actions against fraud or Man in the Middle Hijacking.

### Maintaining Message Integrity

S/MIME prohibits manipulation with the contents since it needs the entire email's content to be reviewed and matched before it is encrypted, therefore any minor modification will result in a notice. As a result, the sender cannot refute the contents of the letter, ensuring openness and accountability.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we strongly recommend Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension for your business because of the benefits it may provide in the long term. If you wish to create integrity, maintain privacy, protect sensitive data, and prevent phishing and other email threats, S/MIME should be incorporated. If you're worried by its difficulty, don't be. S/MIME has gotten easier to adopt over time, with Windows phones being equipped out of the box being a notable example. The technology to secure your emails is widely accessible. You get to decide.
