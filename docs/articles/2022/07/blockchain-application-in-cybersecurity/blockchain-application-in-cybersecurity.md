# Blockchain Application in Cybersecurity
 
Blockchain is a distributed, decentralised digital ledger that records transactions as blocks. Because of its immutability and availability to only authorised individuals, this ledger aids in the storage of information in a transparent manner.

## Blockchain Applications in Cybersecurity

• **IoT safety:** With the rising use of AI and IoT, data and system security from hackers have long been a big worry. A potential use case for maintaining cybersecurity in the IoT system is the usage of Blockchain for increased security by leveraging device-to-device encryption to secure communication, key management mechanisms, and authentication.

• **Software integrity:** Blockchain may be used to validate updates and installers, preventing malicious software from infecting devices. Hashes are logged in the blockchain here, and new software identities may be compared to the hashes to validate the downloads' integrity.

• **Data transmission security:** Encrypting data in transit protects it from illegal access.

• **Decentralized storage of essential data:** With the continually expanding amount of data created each day, blockchain-based storage solutions assist in achieving decentralised storage, hence securing digital information.

• **DDoS Attack Mitigation:** DDoS attacks are one of the most common cyberattacks today, with hackers attempting to produce a torrent of Internet traffic and thereby interrupt the flow of the services. Blockchain's immutability and cryptography qualities contribute to its effectiveness as a response to these threats.

• **DNS security:** The Domain Name System (DNS) functions similarly to a public directory in that it connects domain names to IP addresses. Over time, hackers have attempted to get access to the DNS and abuse these linkages, causing websites to collapse. Because of the immutability and decentralised nature of Blockchain, the DNS may be securely kept.

## Application of Blockchain in Cybersecurity

Blockchain helps ensure all these policies under CIA Triad are satisfied.

**1. Confidentiality:** It involves ensuring that only those who are interested and permitted have access to the relevant data. Full encryption of blockchain data guarantees that unauthorised parties cannot access the data as it travels over untrusted networks. To avoid attacks within the network should be applied security measures, such as access restrictions, directly at the application level. Blockchain can provide additional security measures by authenticating users and encrypting their communication using the PKI (public key infrastructure). However, backup storage of private keys in secondary storage offers a high danger of theft of private keys. Key management processes, as well as cryptographic techniques based on integer factorization issues, should be applied to prevent this.

**2. Integrity:** The immutability and traceability embedded into blockchains assist enterprises in ensuring data integrity. In the case of a 51 percent cyber control attacks, consensus model protocols can also assist companies in implementing procedures to avoid and manage ledger splitting. In Blockchain, the past state of the system is saved with each successive iteration, creating a completely traceable history log. Smart contracts may be used to verify and enforce norms between parties in order to prevent miners from mining data blocks.

**3. Availability:** Cyberattacks intended to disrupt the availability of technological services have increased in recent years, with DDoSs being the most prevalent sort of assault. DDoS assaults, on the other hand, are costly in blockchain-based systems because the attacker attempts to overwhelm the network with a large number of efforts. Because blockchains have no single point of failure, IP-based DDoS assaults are less likely to affect routine operations. Data stays accessible via numerous nodes, allowing entire copies of the ledger to be retrieved at all times. Platforms and systems are more resilient as a result of the combination of several nodes and distributed operation.
