# Securing Privileged Access in the Cloud
 
Securing privileged cloud access begins with knowing what it implies for your business and how incident causes influence you.

Some considerations when for the privileged cloud access are:

**Define your access** Your business activities rely on data, systems, and access, and reliance on these entities differ by company, therefore establish your privileged cloud access. If you're not sure where to begin, consult your disaster recovery strategy, which should classify your important business systems, applications, and data. Then, associate your privileged accounts with your business risk and processes.

**Develop IT cloud access policies** Your company should have a policy in place that specifies appropriate usage and responsibilities for privileged cloud accounts. It's critical that you understand who has privileged access and when it's utilized. Treat privileged accounts separately by explicitly identifying them and outlining permissible use regulations. Identify and track privileged account ownership throughout their life cycle.

**Use a risk register** As part of your IT cloud access strategy, include a risk register that requires each new cloud application to register the data impact risk as well as the privileged access management (PAM) matrix questions. This may be automated using a risk categorization that indicates what further security measures must be incorporated to mitigate any detected hazards.
Discover your privileged accounts: PAM software that is automated recognizes your privileged accounts, executes continuous discovery to prevent privileged account sprawl, detects possible internal misuse, and identifies external risks. Continuous awareness of your privileged account landscape is critical to fighting and mitigating cybersecurity risks.

**Understand business users’ privileged access** All access is becoming privileged, whether because of the account's degree of access or the access people have to important corporate data. Business users come within this group, hence they have privileged access.

**Protect your passwords** Check that your solution can automatically find and store privileged accounts, schedule password rotation, audit, analyze, and manage individual privileged session activities, and monitor accounts to detect and respond to harmful behaviour as promptly as possible. Protecting your privileged account cloud passwords entails more than just using a password manager. Set up Single Sign-on sessions to target systems to improve administrators' operational efficiency by combining multifactor authentication and privileged access protection.

Reduce the capacity of humans to develop and select passwords. This supervision minimizes intrusions that employ tactics like credential stuffing while also reducing exploitation of improper cyber hygiene behaviour like password reuse.

**Limit IT admin access** Create a least­privilege policy to enforce least­privilege on endpoints and limit IT admin access to cloud apps while keeping business operations running smoothly. Privileges should be issued only when necessary and approved. Least-privilege and application control solutions provide for the smooth elevation of approved, trusted, and whitelisted apps while decreasing the danger of unauthorized applications executing.

**Monitor and record sessions** Your PAM system should monitor and record privileged account activities in order to enforce appropriate behavior and prevent user errors. To aid with regulatory compliance, audit, record, and monitor privileged activity.

**Detect abnormal usage** Real-time visibility into your privileged accounts' access and activity aids in the detection of suspected account breach and possible user abuse. Monitor and notify on user behavior. The cost of a data breach is greatly reduced when security breaches are detected early. Because many incidents are caused by compromised third parties, you must manage, monitor, and restrict administrative access of IT outsourcing contractors and managed service providers (MSPs) to cloud and internal IT systems.

**Respond to incidents** In case an account is compromised, include privileged access in your incident response plan. When a privileged account is compromised, just resetting the password or deactivating the privileged account is insufficient.

**Audit and analyze** Continuously monitoring privileged account activity through audits and analytical reports aids in the detection of unexpected behaviors that may signal a breach or misuse. These automated reports trace the source of security events and indicate policy and regulatory compliance.
