# Privacy Information Management System ISO 27701
 
Businesses are under pressure from customers to be more transparent about the data they gather, and authorities are responding. Stakeholders may be assured that your firm takes data privacy seriously by looking for ISO 27701 certification. Consumers produce enormous amounts of data every day in today's globally linked environment. But worries about how businesses collect, utilize, and safeguard this data are growing. Governments all around the globe are enacting comprehensive legislation to guarantee the privacy and security of personal data in response to popular demand. These include, but are not limited to, the California Consumer Privacy Act, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the General Data Protection Law (LGPD) of Brazil (CCPA).

Bureau Veritas provides ISO 27701 certification and training to assist firms in managing personal data in accordance with consumer expectations and in compliance with constantly tighter regulatory policies. By implementing an ISO 27701 Privacy Information Management System (PIMS), you may treat personal data with the utmost accountability and openness.

## Challenges regarding ISO 27701 compliance

Organizations are required by the GDPR to protect all personally identifiable information from theft, loss, and harm. Organizations can handle these three significant compliance difficulties with the aid of ISO 27701:
1.	There are too many regulations to balance
Using ISO 27701 as a single system of operational control for data privacy eliminates the need to concentrate on several policies. As a global standard, ISO 27701 is made to comply with GDPR and data protection laws while still being adaptable enough to satisfy the needs of certain industries. This enables businesses to comply with various regulatory standards while working inside a single framework.

2.	Too expensive to examine each rule individually
In a single audit cycle, internal and external auditors utilize ISO 27701 to assess regulatory compliance. Compared to adopting a fragmented regulation-by-regulation audit procedure, saves the organization money.

3.	Unverifiable promises of cooperation might be dangerous.
It is not sufficient for businesses to adhere to best practices for data privacy; they also need to be able to demonstrate compliance with laws and regulations. That necessitates having a solid, integrated documentation procedure. Complex businesses may use a variety of cloud service providers, partner suppliers, and data controllers and processors. Any portion of the supply chain where it is impossible to demonstrate compliance with rules or regulations might put the company at risk of loss of money and goodwill.  

## Key advantages

1. **PROTECT YOUR REPUTATION** by safeguarding the personal data of customers.
   
2. **TARGET COMPLIANCE**- with laws governing data privacy.
   
3. **IDENTIFY AND REDUCE RISK**- by putting strict privacy measures in place.
   
4. **IMPROVE STAKEHOLDER TRUST**- by making data security the core value of your company.

## Use ISO 27701 to Illustrate Next-level Data Protection

You may advance your Information Security Management System (ISMS) by becoming certified with ISO 27701. As an expansion of ISO 27001 and its sister guidance standard ISO 27002, ISO 27701 establishes additional standards for the management and processing of PII. An ISO 27701 PIMS enables companies of all sizes and industries to take a thorough, risk-based approach to data security. It is applicable to any company that handles or processes personal data and has an ISO 27001 ISMS.

## Conformity to Set Regulation Standards

The concepts and procedures outlined in ISO 27701 are consistent with those outlined in modern data protection laws worldwide. By putting in place an ISO 27701 Privacy Information Management System, firms may more easily show that they are in compliance with these and other legal requirements.

## Build Trust With Internal and External Stakeholders

An organization must routinely generate documentation detailing how it manages personal data and guards against breaches in order to comply with ISO 27701. Having open communication about your organization's data governance demonstrates to customers, staff, investors, clients, and governments that you value privacy.
