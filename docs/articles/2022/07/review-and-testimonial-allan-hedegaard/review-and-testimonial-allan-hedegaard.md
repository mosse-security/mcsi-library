Below is Allan's review of MCSI's platform and method:

<blockquote class="blockquote-yellow">
First and foremost, thanks for the opportunity of providing a little feedback on the last couple of
months experience with the MCSI platform.<br/>
<br/>
Having been through the entire ECO system of IT operation and security, since the mid '00 I have
seen and worked on pretty much everything you would encounter in enterprise IT. Luckily, I have
always been obsessed with my work and the technology it is build upon. So, my work life has never
been a burden, more like a quest for more knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
During my career I have pursued and achieved many certifications from a all the big ones. Cisco,
Comptia, EC etc. I always felt it was vital to attest my know-how and challenge myself.
During 2022 I discovered the Moss√© Cyber Security Institute. I jumped into the MPT course and
thought, that I would complete it in a few weeks or perhaps a month. This assumption was built on
my experience from all previous education programs, that I participated in.<br/>
<br/>
Study the material > Do the exam > Get the certificate.<br/>
<br/>
After reviewing the curriculum, I jumped right into my comfort zone, solving problems. Just like I had
been doing for almost 20 years. I made great progress, as I could simply pick the exercises within my
knowledge bank. After a little time, I found myself more challenged and not able to keep the high
pace in solving exercises.<br/>
<br/>
By reviewing my progress, I was able to pin-point my weaknesses. The MCSI provided me with a
personalized knowledge profile. I found that I knew to little about specific areas, which I never
considered important. Now I was required to study if I wanted to proceed. Having a concrete
problem to use as reference for studying made it much more doable. I reached goals, that I would
not have thought possible.<br/>
<br/>
This was when the realization came to me.<br/>
<br/>
Other courses make you strive for a certification. The Institute is different. The training here makes
you focus on getting smarter. I have not experienced a similar training returning so much output.
There are still huge unchartered knowledge domains out there. The Institutes way of teaching you,
will not only highlight the missing skill(s), but also put you right on track for improving it. Every
submission is awarded with constructive feedback from the instructors. This makes you think even
more about your product and the elegance and finesse of it.<br/>
<br/>
To complete the challenges, you need to be not only logical, but also creative.<br/>
<br/>
The exercises deliver realistic scenarios, so all the skills directly transfer and can be applied in the
real world.<br/>
<br/>
After discovering the potential of the platform, I already enrolled in the MRT course to allow for
even more professional progression.<br/>
<br/>
Any motivated IT professional will benefit tremendously from enrolling at the Institute. I highly
recommend it.<br/>
