# Pillars of Zero Trust Architecture
 
Zero Trust is a security model that requires organizations to verify every user, device, and connection before granting access to data and applications. The goal of Zero Trust is to protect data by ensuring that only authorized users have access to it, regardless of whether they are inside or outside of the network perimeter. In this blog post, we will discuss Zero Trust Architecture components in detail and how they work together to provide comprehensive security for your data in the cloud.

## What are the components of Zero Trust architecture?

As we have already covered in a [previous blog post](zero-trust-the-foundation-of-modern-network-security), Zero Trust is a security methodology and philosophy which transforms security measures away from standard perimeters toward dynamic protection mindset centered on customers and assets. Zero trust architecture is comprised of some foundational elements such as identity, endpoint, data, apps, infrastructure, and network.

Each of those aspects will have general design issues that you should address, as well as particular organizational needs. At the same time, each piece has its own set of basic security best practices that must be followed.

The Zero Trust approach is built on the following core components:

**Identity**: When an identity seeks to access a resource, it is critical to guarantee that the risk of an attacker owning the account is minimal. The identity risk level of a connection might vary depending on the quality of the verification and how close the characteristics and signals are to the account's regular expected behavior.

**Endpoint**: Before allowing access to users on a system, verify that you monitor and ensure device health and compliance.

**Data**: Data is the fundamental storage asset that must be safeguarded, which implies that the security system must comprehend its value and apply the appropriate security policies, which apply the appropriate level of protection everywhere it goes.

**Applications**: Apps enable consumers and devices to access data and provide corporate value, which must be safeguarded. You must establish the proper access policies and ensure that the required controls and settings, such as the deployment of the access model, are enforced on all applications.

You should also grant or prohibit access based on real-time data and statistics; watch for any unexpected activity, and respond promptly to application attacks to reduce the time attackers have access to them.

**Infrastructure**: Irrespective of whether your infrastructure is on-premises, in the cloud, or hybrid, maintain an excellent security posture (such as security updates, secure settings) and identify attacks and abnormalities using all possible metrics. Block and report harmful actions instantly, and take precautionary measures.

**Network**: Because the network offers connection as well as access control, it should be tightly integrated into an enterprise access-control strategy that includes identity controls.

It is still a good idea to provide private networks for current applications that defend against unauthorized web traffic networks (such as network segmentation). However, more precise micro-segmentation may be used to further safeguard workloads against private network intrusions. Shifting operations to the cloud is an excellent opportunity to increase real-time threat prevention, end-to-end protection, surveillance, and statistics throughout all networks.

## Conclusion

Upon completion of this blog page, we have learned that all parts of the Zero Trust architecture collaborate to offer end-to-end security. A security policy that applies the Zero Trust methodology across these core pillars assists your businesses in delivering and enforcing security throughout the company.
