Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Jeremy. I live in France. I'm 18 years old and I've been learning cybersecurity on my own for several years.<br/>
<br/>
Like others, I have worked on various high profile platforms. 
<br/
I was also one of the youngest in the world to get one of the most recognized certifications: I tried harder :)
...<br/>
<br/>
After comparison, having really tried these platforms, my point of view is very simple:
<br/>
<br/>
MCSI is by far the best. Really by far.<br/>
<br/>
Here is why:<br/>
<br/>
-MCSI is the cheapest or among the cheapest<br/>
-The exercises are varied, captivating and stick to reality<br/>
-No time limit to finish the course<br/>
-No stressful lab to pay for if you don't finish it<br/>
-No 800 pages of documentation to read when you don't know what to remember<br/>
-No waste of time<br/>
-A wide variety of courses. Each syllabus is clear and precise<br/>
-MCSI corrects exercises very quickly, personalized feedback, it is very motivating<br/>
<br/>
MCSI is the absolute weapon to become a cybersecurity expert.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a real motivation, MCSI will make you what you want to be: One of the best.<br/>
