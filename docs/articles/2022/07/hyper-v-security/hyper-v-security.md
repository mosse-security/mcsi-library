# Hyper-V security
 
Many people consider security to be a clearly evident necessity. Others' needs may not be as obvious. Many decision-makers don't think that the product of their company needs extensive protection. Many administrators think the default security measures are adequate. While certain organizations' needs may not necessitate a rigorous program of safeguards, no one can avoid doing their research.

## Your clients expect it

Every organization type offers some kind of service to someone, albeit the precise concept of a "customer" differs from one organization to the next. Your institution has an implicit agreement to protect the information pertinent to those who depend on you, whether you are a retail establishment or a non-profit that offers intangible services to people in need who cannot pay for them. They'll probably have no idea what Hyper-V is or what you do with it, but they'll know enough to be angry if any of your computer systems are found to be insecure. If customers feel their data is not being treated with enough importance, your company may be subject to legal action.

## Stakeholders expect it

Stakeholders, like clients, can signify many different things. To put it simply, it's anyone who has a "stake" in the success of your company. This can be a board of director members who aren't familiar with daily operations. External investors may be involved. It might even include the clients who were mentioned earlier. They expect that it will be handled even if they have no means of knowing what should or shouldn't be secured. They can also disagree with you about the data that needs to be protected. The reaction could have very bad repercussions if it becomes out that information that was expected to be handled as very confidential wasn't completely guarded.

## Your volunteers and staff expect it

A portion of the critical information on employees and volunteers has been digitally stored by almost all organizations. They demand that this information be treated with the utmost secrecy and protected from theft and espionage. Personnel data must always be protected, even if the rest of your institution's data doesn't need any special safeguards. This is a prerequisite under the law in several jurisdictions. Civil litigation is always an option, even where there is no rule of law.

## We know from experience how crucial security is

In the past, it was thought that attackers were external to the organization and only interested in quick and simple cash sources, including credit card details. But as experience has taught us, breaches happen for a variety of reasons, and many of them aren't discovered until it's too late to stop them.

## Not all flaws are immediately apparent

You are aware that frontend passwords must be used to secure access to sensitive backend data. You are aware that any data transferred between the two must be encrypted. Do you, however, know every location the data will pass through? Is the storage space not secured? Has a recent audit of those with access been conducted? Exists another program on one of the component systems that permit remote access or unencrypted communication? Any system that is treated as though it doesn't require security risks becomes a route for unauthorized users.

## Fundamental security issues

It can be challenging to know where to begin when discussing a subject as vast as computer security. Finding out where and what your biggest risk factors are is usually the best place to start. There are a few general issues that everyone needs to be concerned about, even if each organization will have its own unique areas of concern.
