# Getting started with Security Operations Center SOC
 
A group of IT experts and information security specialists that analyse, monitor, and defend a company against cyber-attacks work out of a centralized location known as a security operations centre (SOC). SOC teams handle incident response while continuously keeping an eye on networks, internet traffic, servers, desktops, databases, endpoint devices, applications, and other IT assets in case of security incidents. SOC personnel typically possess all the knowledge and abilities necessary to recognize and address cybersecurity events. To share information regarding occurrences with the proper stakeholders, they work in tandem with other departments or teams. The majority of SOCs run continuously, with staff members working in shifts to oversee log activity and minimize threats. Some businesses use outside vendors to handle their SOC. The use of SOCs is a crucial tactic for reducing the expenses associated with data breaches. They support organizations in quickening their response to intrusions and continuously enhance threat detection and prevention techniques.

## Advantages of SOC

A security operations center's primary benefit is improving security issue detection through ongoing analysis and constant activity monitoring. SOC teams guarantee prompt detection and reaction to security problems by continuously monitoring this activity across an organization's endpoints, servers, networks, and databases. Regardless of the time of day, the source, or the type of attack, organizations rely on the SOC to defend against security incidents and breaches.

The average amount of time it takes to find and address a breach is over 100 days, according to numerous studies. Establishing a SOC aids firms in enhancing their capacity to quickly identify and respond to risks in order to stop or lessen the devastation caused by cyber-attacks.

## SOC Challenges

-**Talent Gap**

There are numerous open cybersecurity jobs due to the significant scarcity of cybersecurity expertise. Due to a talent shortage, there are millions of open cybersecurity roles around the world. Due to this shortage, SOC management struggles to find employees and runs the risk of existing team members becoming burnt out and leaving. A SOC should look within to find talent and think about training staff to fill in any vacancies on the SOC team. Every crucial SOC role also needs a backup, or someone with the qualifications to keep things operating in case the important role is suddenly vacant.

A key component of an organization's cybersecurity strategy is network protection. Because competent fraudsters are capable of getting through standard protections like endpoint security and firewalls, it calls for attention. To overcome this challenge it is needed to implement anomaly detection or machine learning systems, which can identify sophisticated threats and eliminate the need for a manual inquiry.

-**Big Data**

The average business deals with a huge amount of data and network traffic. The issue of real-time data analysis has grown as a result of the massive expansion of log data.
Solution of this challenge is to enable convenient, centralized analysis, SOCs use automated technologies to interpret, filter, correlate, and aggregate information.

-**Alert Fatigue**

There are a lot of anomalies and security alarms in many security systems. If the SOC relies on unfiltered notifications, the volume of these alerts can rise very quickly. Many notifications are either false positives or lack the context necessary to fully analyse the situation. Teams are diverted from actual security incidents by these kinds of poor-quality warnings.
An effective alert prioritization approach is essential for a SOC. Enhancing warning quality and distinguishing between alerts of low and high priority is essential. By using behavioural analytics technologies, you can make sure that SOC teams focus on the most pressing problems first.

-**Unknown risks**

Unknown threats cannot be found using traditional signature-based detection, firewalls, or endpoint detection. SOCs have a hard time identifying and defending against zero-day threats. By leveraging behaviour analytics to identify odd behaviour, SOC teams can improve their rules, signatures, and threshold-based threat detection solutions.

-**Overusing Security**

To find every potential threat, many firms purchase a number of security tools. These solutions frequently lack connectivity, have a narrow field of use, and are unable to detect sophisticated attacks that traverse security silos. Implementing different layers of the IT system to identify sophisticated or evasive threats, is the solution.
