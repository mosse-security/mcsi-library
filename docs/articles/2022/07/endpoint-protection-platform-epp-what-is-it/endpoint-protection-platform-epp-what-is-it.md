# Endpoint Protection Platform EPP What is it
 
Because ransomware attacks target the endpoint, encrypt its data, and demand a payment to decrypt them, endpoint protection is more crucial than ever. The COVID-19-driven shift to remote work has also raised endpoints' susceptibility to cyber threats and turned them into an organization's first line of defense.
An extensive endpoint security plan that can handle the contemporary cybersecurity concerns that endpoints encounter must be created and implemented by organizations. And a vital part of this approach is the implementation of an endpoint protection platform (EPP).

## Why is EPP necessary?

An EPP solution, functioning as a preventative first line of defense against cyber threats to the endpoint, recognizes malware that functions only in memory, malicious scripts, and file-based and file-less malware. It then prevents these threats from being executed on a system.
The threat analysis and remediation capabilities offered by EPP are crucial for business cybersecurity as malware gets more complex and pervasive. Security teams need a solution that shields their endpoints from various threats and gives them the resources they need to quickly and efficiently fix any successful incursions

## How do I choose an endpoint security system?

The following are the primary criteria of top endpoint security systems:

**Several threat detections and response techniques**. An EPP has several technologies for detection and correction built into the platform. Anti-malware signature scanning, online browser security, threat vector blocking (to stop malware that doesn't use files), monitoring for credential theft, and rollback cleanup are a few of these features. Different technologies and methods for threat detection and redress may be included by an EPP provider. Endpoint security products are progressively using the following two technologies:

**1. Endpoint detection and response (EDR)**, which keeps track of endpoint activities and records data for further analysis.

EPP serves as the initial line of protection against cyber-attacks by preventing threats to endpoints. This prevention-focused strategy might not, however, identify every possible hazard.
EPP ought to be used in conjunction with an EDR solution because of this. EDR products are made to assist with threat detection and carry out endpoint threat hunting. Cyberattacks at the endpoint may be identified and countered with full-spectrum assistance from a system that combines proactive EDR and preventative EPP.

**2. Data loss prevention (DLP)**, which forbids end users from disseminating confidential information outside of the company.

**Live threats.** To identify and stop zero-day threats, an EPP needs constant access to real-time threat data both within the business and worldwide. The EPP provider should make a worldwide database of current threat activities accessible.

**Integration framework**. A framework that permits information sharing amongst security solutions, including any third-party products that may already be deployed in the company, is the right foundation for an Endpoint Protection Platform. The latter might incorporate EDR, DLP, and intrusion protection. An open architecture enables the visibility and monitoring of all endpoints and endpoint security solutions across the enterprise via a single interface or dashboard. Furthermore, the cooperative sharing of information among products helps speed up the detection and removal of dangerous hazards.

**Centralized administration** A central interface for controlling all endpoints and security features should be offered by an EPP. This one pane of glass eliminates the need for IT workers to switch between screens in order to manually analyze threat information. An intuitive dashboard that can be customized with alarms, key performance indicators (KPIs), the current security situation, and the ability to dig down into specific endpoints and threats should be provided through a single interface.

Platforms for endpoint security assist in defending companies from assaults on endpoints that are weak. Additionally, an EPP enables information about security events from various security solutions to be exchanged, allowing for more thorough analysis and a clearer knowledge of how to enhance endpoint security across the enterprise.
