# The Importance of Data Backup and Recovery for an Organization
 
Over recent years, data has become one of the most critical assets for the organization. This data can include financial spreadsheets, blueprints on new products, an organization's trade secrets, private customer information and so much more. Any security incident that can damage or destroy this data can have severe repercussions for the organization and in some cases can cause the organization to become bankrupt. An organization with strong business continuity and disaster recovery planning takes into account all the scenarios that can adversely affect its critical assets. Data backup and recovery mechanisms in an organization, therefore, play a crucial role in the organization's recovery procedures. This article goes over the importance of data backup and recovery, its types, and the different storage options available to the organization for storing this backup data.

## What is meant by a Data Backup?

A data backup, in the context of information technology, is a copy of the critical information that resides on the computer or a device and is kept in a different location. The main reason for keeping these backups is to be able to recover crucial information in the event that an unexpected circumstance calls for the company to restore the previous data. A software bug that corrupts an organization's operational data, testing a new software patch, a natural disaster that damages the facility and its infrastructure, and many other occurrences are examples of the events that necessitate backing up the previously stored data.

One of the proactive methods that can reduce the risk posed by security threats for an organization is data backup. By considering all the possible ways that this data could be harmed and establishing reliable and secure recovery processes, the organization can be guaranteed that it can keep running even under the most trying circumstances. The Business Continuity Planning team of the organization is in charge of implementing sufficient security controls in accordance with organizational requirements that can successfully recover crucial data in the event of a security incident.

## Why is it important to have a data backup

Data loss is a very common occurrence. Just because an organization has not faced such a disaster doesn't mean that they are prone to such incidents. Some of the reasons why it is important to have a data backup are given below:

* Organizations these days are heavily dependent on technology. The technology landscape has evolved to great extent. It has led to nearly all organizations having their precious data stored in the digital format. However, this technology is prone to failure in numerous ways such as endpoints or workstations getting infected with malware, ransomware attacks targeting important computing devices, electrical power surges leading to device failure, and so much more. It is therefore extremely important to plan ahead of such failures that can disrupt the critical business operations of the organization.

* Human error is yet another reason to have a data backup in place. Even if a company's personnel are well-trained to accomplish their jobs, human error is very likely to occur. Some of the most important resources in the company are accessible to the staff. If suitable data backup and restoration methods are not in place, even a small error might have serious effects. Therefore, it is essential to implement data backup and recovery solutions that will guarantee that any mistakes caused by human error are identified and fixed as soon as possible.

* Natural disasters can also prove to be highly disastrous for businesses, in addition to technical faults and human error. The organization's facility may sustain extensive damage as a result of natural disasters including fires, floods, earthquakes, and others. Additionally, the infrastructure of the company that houses the vital data may be harmed. If an organization is tries to restart its operations after a natural disaster without a data backup and recovery plan in place, then this operation can be very difficult for them. When a backup plan is in place, businesses don't need to worry about damage to their operations or reputation. Instead, they may quickly locate crucial information via their data storage option. After that, the business can resume as usual.

* Data is an organization's key asset, or its crown jewel, as was previously stated. This data is also vulnerable to theft depending on how important it is to the organization. Numerous threat actors, including hackers, nefarious insiders, disgruntled employees, etc., have the ability to steal vital information from a business and cause harm to it. Theft of crucial organizational data is a security risk for which the company needs to take all necessary precautions. Therefore, it is crucial to keep a backup of your data to prevent its permanent deletion from your computers.

## Types of Data Backup

Data changes continually in an organization. Therefore the frequency of these backups depends upon the criticality of the data and how often the data changes. This data backup must be done in a way that is reasonable and effective at recovering the data. There are numerous types of data backup and backup solutions, each of which is created to address a different problem, vulnerability, and storage requirement. It might be challenging to determine the type of backup you should perform, but it is crucial to perform continuous backups to keep your organization secure. 

Selecting the data that is backed up and how frequently it should be backed up is up to the organization's operations staff. These backups, which may be full, differential, or incremental, are frequently used in conjunction with one another. In order to conserve time and resources, it is preferable to develop a backup strategy that does not continuously backup data that has not been modified as the bulk of files are not changed every day. For this purpose the data backup software in an organization can use an archive bit. By setting an archive bit, operating system file systems keep track of which files have been modified. When a file is modified or created, the file system switches the archive bit from 0 to 1. Backup software must be built to take this bit setting into account when selecting what gets backed up and what doesn't. Different methods of data backup are possible in an organization, including:

### Full Data Backup

A full data backup technique, as the name suggests, is a sort of data backup in which all the data (such as certain files and folders) are backed up and stored in a particular location. In this type of data backup, the archive bit is set to 0. If a company decides to just perform full backups, the backup and restore procedures may take a long time; however, in such a case, the restoration process only needs one step. Most frequently, incremental or differential backups are used in conjunction with this sort of data backup; each is discussed in more detail below.

### Differential Backup

The files that have changed since the last complete backup are backed up using a differential backup technique. When data needs to be restored, the complete backup is first loaded, and then the most recent differential backup is installed on top of it. The value of the archive bit is unaffected by the differential procedure.

### Incremental Backup

The archive bit is set to 0 during an incremental procedure, which backs up all files that have changed since the last complete or incremental backup. When the data needs to be restored, the entire backup data is first set up, followed by each incremental backup in the right order, and finally the restored data. If a business adopted the incremental method and faced a disaster, it would first need to restore the entire backup and lay down every incremental backup that had been performed up until the incident (and after the last full backup). For example, if the full backup was performed six months ago and the operations department had performed an incremental backup every month, the full backup would be restored first. After the restoration team has restored the full backup, it would then go on to older incremental backups taken since the full backup, and so on until all of them had been restored.

## How to Choose the Perfect Data Backup Strategy for your Organization

Your organization's particular backup and recovery needs will determine whatever data backup solution you choose to implement. Given that it has the necessary resources in the form of hard drive space and the time required to complete these operations, the organization can choose to have a full backup if it needs the backup and delivery processes to be straightforward and hassle-free. However, if a business has limited time and money, it makes sense to adopt either an incremental or differential data backup method. Despite being quicker, compared to a full backup process, the execution of these backup techniques can be difficult. In comparison to an incremental backup method, a differential backup process takes longer to backup. On the other hand, recovering from a differential backup is quicker than an incremental backup. When restoring an incremental backup, each incremental backup must be restored in the correct order, unlike when restoring a differential backup, which simply needs to be restored in two steps.

## Types of Data Backup Locations

Data backups for an organization need to be made in several places. The fact that the organization has its data backed up in numerous places assures that it can keep running no matter what happens and that data recovery is possible in a variety of scenarios. There are primarily two types of data backup locations:

### Onsite Data Backup

The copies of the data are kept at the same location as the organization's premises in an onsite data backup. Typically, these backups are saved on a unique internal or external hard drive that can be physically attached to the source computer for backup and recovery process. Most often, these backups are employed in the event of non-disaster situations like a technical malfunction. The onsite data backup needs to be kept in a location that is waterproof, heat-resistant, and fire-resistant. In order to minimize the impact of disasters on the organization, the onsite backup must be secured. The procedures for backing up and restoring data should be easily accessible and comprehensible to different personnel in the organization.

### Offsite Data Backup

If an organization simply has onsite data backup, that is not sufficient. It is quite likely that the onsite backups will also be affected by a natural disaster that damages the primary facility, such as a flood, earthquake, or fire. Because of this, it is crucial to keep the data backup offsite as well, ensuring that the offsite facility is spared from the same disaster that strikes the primary one. The distance of the site from the main facility should be one of the important factors to consider when selecting the location for the offsite backup. Offsite backup storage facilities that are closer to the company's main facility are easier to access, but this could put backup copies in danger if a catastrophic disaster damages both the main facility and the backup facility. To maximize accessibility while reducing danger, it can be wiser to choose a backup facility that is farther away. Some companies decide to have two backup locations, one nearby and one farther away.

## Backup Storage Options

When comes to storing your backup data, there are many options to choose from. The choice of the appropriate storage medium depends upon your company's specific business needs. Some of the most common technologies that are used for storing your backup data are as follows:

### Removable Drives

Removable media consists of portable media devices such as CDs, DVDs, or USBs that can be easily used with desktops and laptops. These storage devices are appropriate for smaller environments where the backed up data doesn't require a large storage capacity. However, for storing large volumes of data other storage options are more suitable and secure.

### External Hard Drives

External hard drives such as SSDs (Solid-State Drives) have a much higher storage capacity as compared to removable drives/media. These drives get connected to desktops or laptops via a cable or wirelessly and are capable of storing a large number of files that can be accessed readily.

### Cloud Backup

Cloud Backup services allow the users to backup their data on a server in a remote location. This backup storage option is extremely flexible and allows the user to access their data over the internet connection. Some of the most popular Cloud Storage Service Providers include iCloud, Google Drive, and DropBox. These cloud storage services provide a large amount of storage space and can also encrypt the data to protect it from different attack vectors.

### Backup Software Solutions

Backup Software solutions allow the organizations to define which systems or data need to be backed up. It also allows the user to configure where to store the backup data as well as manages the data backup process automatically. This back up software although difficult to employ, offers great flexibility if it is correctly configured. 

### Hardware Backup Devices

Specially built hardware backup devices have a large amount of storage capacity as well as built-in backup software. The data begins streaming to the backup device when you install backup agents on the systems you need to back up and choose your backup schedule and policy.

## Test Your Backups Regularly

The ability to restore data from a backup is much better than backing it up in the first place. The fact that many organizations have a very well-organized and efficient method for backing up their data has led many of them to believe that they are secure. That feeling of security can vanish in an instant if a business discovers during a crisis that its restoration procedures do not truly work. Therefore, it is crucial that your organization not only implements backup solutions but also frequently tests them.
