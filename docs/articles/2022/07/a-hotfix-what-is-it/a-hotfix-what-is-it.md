# A Hotfix What Is It
 
A hotfix is an immediate repair for a problem or defect that often skips the standard software development cycle. Hotfixes are often applied to high- or severe-priority defects that need to be fixed very away, such as a fault that compromises the software's functioning or security.
Because there is a lot to test and not enough time to accomplish it, software development teams always produce flaws or bugs. The company ranks reported problems and flaws as critical, severe, high, medium, or low as they come in (or other similar terms). Depending on the release timetable, critical flaws typically call for a hotfix.

**Default hotfix timeline**

For each release, software testers and developers collaborate in a sprint to add new features and address bugs. A strategy for a quick code-and-test process is discussed by developers and testers when the organization compiles the problem information following the occurrence of a hotfix. Up until the hotfix is coded, tested, and delivered, further work is suspended.
Unit testing is performed once the problem has been coded, and then the fix is pushed to the test server (s). The QA expert in charge of testing the problem patch verifies it in the test server. If it succeeds, it is pushed to a separate test server known as **Staging**, however, it may also be deployed directly to **Production** in rare cases. The QA tester often does a fundamental smoke test against all functionality and the problem patch in production, if practicable, depending on the remedy's nature, such as whether it addresses a serious security vulnerability or a crucial functionality issue. Because there is a high chance of failure while testing on a live **Production** server, hotfix testing is frequently limited to the **Staging** server.
The team then goes back to its sprint or release work after the hotfix has been pushed and made live.

**The best ways to avoid hotfixes**

1.	Add functional specifics to user narrative or requirements description;
2.	Enhance the design or think about utilizing prototypes prior to coding;
3.	Provide time for the creation of unit tests;
4.	Use integrated automated unit testing prior to each code launch;
5.	Take into account implementing continuous integration and continuous deployment;
6.	Provide more thorough documentation for testing and development.

**4 hotfix testing suggestions**

A tester will probably test thousands of hotfixes throughout the course of their career. They can't be avoided. What's the best method to test a hotfix as extensively as possible while everyone on the team is operating in fire drill mode and mayhem is rife?

- Before testing a hotfix, testers must carry out the following four essential steps: 

1. Recognize the task at hand. Talk through the specifics of the issue and the intended outcome of the fix with the engineers who are creating the fix.

2. Pose inquiries. With the product team, go over the anticipated features. Make decisions about what you can and cannot test based on these interactions.

3. List all the things that require testing. Include any integrated functionality that is impacted by the flaw in this list. Checklists are quick to construct and simple to use during testing, guaranteeing that all pertinent items are evaluated. The foundation documentation for any test cases is also provided via checklists. written post-deployment.

4. Regression test based on the flaw. Identify any additional functionality that the hotfix adjustment may affect. Test as many of the related features as you can. Add the test procedures to the regression or smoke test suite for later execution when the hotfix testing is finished.

5. Remember that hotfixes are a last resort and shouldn't be used often. Consider using a more thorough testing approach that takes use of worldwide crowd testers who can simulate the actual use of your product in order to increase your test coverage and prevent major faults from occurring in the first place.
