**Hello Łukasz! You have been a student on the MCSI Online Learning Platform for a while now. Can
you please tell us about how you embarked on your learning journey?**

Hello and thank you for the opportunity for an interview.

I am working in Information Technology and Information Security for around 17 years now. I started
as a helpdesk specialist and junior administrator at the beginning of my university time. Then I was a
developer, administrator, DevOps, security office/manager, and finally a penetration tester. I was
always interested in security and along the way, it became not only my job but also my passion and
hobby. It requires constant learning and development so I am always on the lookout for new courses
that would increase my skills and learn something new. I came across the MCSI platform when
googling for a course about vulnerability research. It turned out to give great access to broaden the
knowledge in a wide area of cybersecurity and not only individual techniques. You don't have
everything served on a plate but you need to discover and research everything by yourself. That
makes MCSI unique!

**Did you enroll in any of the MCSI Certifications?**

Yes, I enrolled in the MVRE - Certified Vulnerability Researcher and Exploitation Specialist. I think this
course’s practical approach makes for its outstanding value. It makes you research the given problem
by yourself and therefore develops your creative thinking on the solution.

**That's great to know! Did another MCSI Certification interest you?**

I also enrolled in Bootcamp to check what it looks like. It was a great opportunity to develop the skills
I use at work daily.

**What was your first impression of the platform?**

I was impressed by how well organized and user-friendly the platform was.

**Were you able to navigate through the platform with ease?**

Navigation is very easy, all the topics are logically listed and I had no trouble finding anything I
needed.

**How would you describe your learning experience so far?**

I am very satisfied with my learning experience on the MCSI platform. It is like a cybersecurity gym
with a routine of exercises always ready to perform by yourself. Whenever I have the time, I can log
in and practice.

**Did you require any special equipment to work on the exercises?**

I only need a computer with sufficient power to run virtual machines.

**Did you encounter any challenges while working on the exercises? If yes, how did you navigate
through them?**

Almost every exercise was a challenge and that's the point of learning on the MCSI platform.
Overcoming them is part of the learning process and I appreciate that.

**How was your experience submitting the solutions for every exercise?**

I like receiving feedback and getting to know what further I may improve. This makes all the work
rewarding and satisfying.

**For exercises that involved a video submission, did you have to learn video editing skills?**

No, I only familiarized myself with OBS Studio to record videos.

**Were you comfortable with how the exercises were graded upon submission?**

Yes. It was clear and gave an understandable output of my submissions.

**How do you expect your career to advance with the skills you have gained from the Online
Learning Platform?**

The skills I learned and developed during the courses help me every day in my work and I use them
on daily basis.

**Who do you think is the appropriate audience for this platform?**

This platform is for everyone who wants to learn from basics and those who wish to continue their
development further.

**On an ending note, what would you like to tell our readers about the MCSI Online Learning
Platform?**

I would and do recommend the MCSI platform to anyone looking for an interesting opportunity to
develop vulnerability research skills and cybersecurity in general.
