# Top 5 Reverse Image Search Tools

A reverse image search feeds a picture to a search engine for analysis, whereas a conventional internet search includes typing words into a search engine for relevant results. It operates by uploading a picture or entering its URL into a reverse image search engine, which will check its database for additional areas where such an image exists online and show all of them. Thus, you can determine the source of images. The findings may differ based on the website you chose. In this blog post, we will take a look at the top 5 tools that you can use for reverse image search.

Let’s start by explaining what is a reverse image search.

## Reverse image search engine tools

Here are various reverse image search engine websites you can utilize:

**Yandex**

**Bing**

Bing is another web search engine that you can use for reverse image searches. By clicking the camera symbol to the right of the search area, you may also access Bing Images. Although you will obtain fewer results than Google Image Search, you will be able to match more photos. There are several ways to search for reverse images, including copying the image or URL, snapping a snapshot, and dragging an image.

Lastly, let's take a look at Baidu.

**Baidu Images**

Baidu is a Chinese search engine. Baidu, like other search engines, provides a reverse image search. Baidu presently does not have an English version of its site and solely displays Chinese content. For better demonstrative purposes, we used Google Translate in the screenshots below. When you go to Baidu, you'll see a search box with a little camera symbol to the right.
