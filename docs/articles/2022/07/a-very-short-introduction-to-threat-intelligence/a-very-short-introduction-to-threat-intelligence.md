# A Very Short Introduction to Threat Intelligence
 
In this blog post, we are going to answer what is threat intelligence, and why it is essential, what are differences between data, information and intelligence to help you better understand the importance of threat intelligence in enhancing your defensive skills

## What is threat intelligence?

Threat intelligence, which is also known as cyber threat intelligence (CTI) or simply cyber intelligence, is the knowledge gained through evaluating information regarding possible or ongoing attacks that pose a risk to the company. Simply put, this process is the intelligent collecting and analysis of information to assist enterprises in developing proactive security architecture for successful decision-making. Intelligence is gathered, digested, and evaluated in order to establish the motivations, intentions, and abilities of a threat actor; all with the goal of concentrating on an incident or patterns to inform and provide an edge for defensive players properly.

CTI is supported by evidence, and the proof is the cornerstone of the information needed to develop a successful cyber threat management unit for any firm.

## Data, information, and intelligence

Let’s make a distinction between these concepts to provide a better understanding. When discussing CTI, it is critical to distinguish between data, information, and intelligence. It is critical to comprehend the distinctions between data, information, and intelligence in order to more efficiently store, analyze, and determine trends.

An IP address, virus hash, or domain name are all examples of data. Information is validated data, but it frequently missing in the context required for strategic action, such as an IP address that lacks malicious/benign classification or conceptualization. Finally, intelligence adds another layer of analysis and dimension to that information and data, making it operational, such as a feed of malware hashes connected with criminal actors based in Asia.

## Why threat intelligence is crucial?

It is vital to consider and master adversaries' techniques to launch cyberattacks and detect incursions. Threat actors employ tactics, techniques, and procedures (which are abbreviated as TTPs). Organizations may then target cyber threats from the origin rather than the surface.

Understanding the intents, capabilities, objectives, resources, and thinking process of a threat actor results in a more educated defense. Finally, by better managing, all lines of business inside an organization, a more knowledgeable defensive player may make tangible adjustments to a company's risk profile.

## Landscape in threat intelligence and emerging threats

Many businesses see threat intelligence as a product that enables them to build defensive cyber gates. However, adversaries shift tactics and strategies as the intelligence team creates systems to guard against present and prospective threats.
It is critical for the intelligence team to put in place systems that enable the analysis and collection of new threats. As a result, the process becomes a loop that is constantly scrutinized to ensure that businesses are not only responsive but also proactive. The phrase threat intelligence life cycle refers to the process of implementing an effective cyber threat intelligence project in a business.

## Conclusion

Threat intelligence is a continuous process because attackers alter their techniques, and businesses should do the same. Data gathering, processing, analyzing, and production are all procedures for translating data into threat intelligence. Comprehending the significance of threat intelligence and the distinction between data, information, and intelligence is critical for a well-established threat intelligence program.
