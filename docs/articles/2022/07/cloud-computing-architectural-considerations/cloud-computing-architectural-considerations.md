# Cloud Computing Architectural Considerations
 
The installation and performance of cloud security architecture are influenced by a number of factors. There are broad concerns about regulatory obligations, standard adherence, security management, and information categorization. Then there are more architecturally specialized aspects such as trustworthy hardware and software, providing a secure execution environment, enabling secure connections, and hardware augmentation via microarchitectures.

A wide range of issues influences and directly affect cloud security architecture.
Compliance, security management, administrative challenges, controls, and security awareness are among them.

The cloud security architecture should assist in compliance with legal standards. As a consequence, the cloud security policy should cover information categorization, who may possibly access information, under what conditions access must be granted, the geographical jurisdiction of the stored data, and whether or not access is appropriate. Proper controls should be established and tested using assurance techniques, and suitable employee awareness training should be implemented.

## Compliance

In a public cloud environment, the provider often does not disclose clients of the location of their data storage. In reality, one of the cloud's core properties is the spread of processing and data storage. However, the cloud provider should work with the customer to meet the client's data location needs.

Furthermore, the cloud vendor should give the customer with transparency by providing information about storage consumed, processing capabilities. Another compliance concern is the provider's system engineers and certain other personnel having access to a client's data.

This component is required for offering and sustaining cloud services; nevertheless, the act of getting sensitive information should be monitored, managed, and safeguarded by protections such as separation of duties. The capacity of local law enforcement officials to access a client's sensitive data is a worry when information is held in a foreign country.

## Security Management

To get the benefits of cloud computing, security design must include efficient security management. Management difficulties in crucial areas such as access control, vulnerability analysis, change control, incident response, fault tolerance, disaster recovery, and business continuity planning should be identified via proper cloud security management and administration. The correct application and verification of cloud security measures improves and supports these areas.

## Controls

The goal of cloud security measures is to decrease vulnerabilities to a manageable level while also minimizing the impact of an attack. To do this, an organization must estimate the potential impact of an assault as well as the chance of defeat.

Compromise of sensitive information, financial thievery, loss of reputation, and physical damage of resources are all examples of loss.

There are many different types of controls, however they are typically classified into one of four categories:

* **Deterrent controls –** Lower the chance of a planned assault.
  
* **Preventative controls –** Protect weaknesses and make an assault ineffective or less damaging. * Preventative measures deter attempts to breach security regulations.
  
* **Corrective controls –** Limit the impact of an assault.
  
* **Detective controls -** Detect assaults and activate preventative or remedial controls. Detective controls, which include intrusion detection systems, organizational policies, video cameras, and motion detectors, warn of infractions or attempted violations of security policy.

## Information Classification

Information categorization is another important aspect of compliance that can have an impact on cloud security architecture. The categorizing of information also aids in disaster recovery and business continuity planning.

Advantages of Information Classification

Using information categorization offers numerous obvious advantages for a cloud computing enterprise. Among these advantages are the following:

* It displays an organization's dedication to security safeguards.
  
* It aids in determining which information is the most sensitive or critical to a business.
  
* It adheres to the principles of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
  
* It aids in determining which safeguards apply to which data.
  
* It may be necessary for regulatory, compliance, or legal reasons.
