# How to Sustain Compliance in Organizations
 
In this blog post, we will explore types of compliance, the importance of complying with the laws and regulations, and various steps that help us to stay compliant. Letâ€™s start by defining what is compliance in simple terms...

## What is compliance?

Compliance simply refers to following the laws and regulations that surround the data you manage and the business in which you work. You can measure compliance by measuring against the standard to which you are conforming.

## What are compliance types?

In this section of the blog post, we will take a look at each of the following compliance types. The two types of compliance are as the following:

- regulatory compliance
- and industry compliance.

**Regulatory compliance**

Regulatory compliance refers to your conformity to the regulations that apply to the industry in which you operate. Typically, it entails periodic checks and evaluations to guarantee that everything is done as per requirements. An important element of regulatory compliance auditing. Preparing and conducting audits may provide an opportunity to detect and address problems more effectively.

**Industry compliance**

Industry compliance is conformity to laws that are not imposed by law. Although it is not enforced, nonconformity to industry compliance may have serious consequences for the business. We can give an example of PCI DSS. Organizations that take credit cards must adhere to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. This is a standard that provides the guidelines for a security program, as well as precise criteria for data protection and security measures.

## Keeping compliant best practices

You can benefit from the following efforts to maintain your compliance.

**Monitor your controls continuously**: You must continuously evaluate your controls evaluate their efficiency. Do they successfully minimize or decrease risk? Do they continue to perform as planned? Without such monitoring, your controls may rapidly cease to function.

**Review your controls periodically**: You must review your controls on a regular basis to ensure that they are still functional and satisfy the goals for risk management. Do you need additional controls? Are there any controls that need to be retired? Do your current controls cover the existent risks? As existing risks develop and new risks emerge, you must ensure that your controls continue to adequately function effectively.

**Document any versions/modifications**: You should carefully track any alterations to a control's settings and record the outcomes of your assessments. Documentation allows you to examine patterns allowing you to foresee the resources you may require later.

**Report management**: You must submit the outcomes to your management after tracking, evaluating, and recording the status of your controls. The recording helps the management to make educated choices for the business.

## Final Words

Modern regulations are continually updated and evolving. Businesses must follow the requirements and laws in this growing environment and maintain compliance by following the steps we covered above.
