# Information Protection Balancing Costs and Benefits
 
Information protection serves to safeguard an organization's priceless assets, including its information, hardware, and software.

Eight key components should form the foundation of information protection:

1. Information protection should assist the enterprise's mission or commercial goals. It is imperative to emphasize this point. Information security professionals frequently forget their objectives and duties. The enterprise is supported by the ISSO (Information Systems Security Officer), not the other way around.
   
2. Information security is a crucial component of exercising due care. Senior management has two primary duties: a duty of loyalty, which requires that all choices be made in the best interests of the company; and a duty of care, which calls for senior management to safeguard the company's assets and make wise business decisions. Senior management will receive help from an efficient information protection program in carrying out these responsibilities.
   
3. Cost-effective information protection is required. The business environment is not supported by implementing controls based on directives. It is vital to ensure that a considerable risk exists prior to any recommended controls. This can be achieved by implementing a prompt risk analysis procedure. The mission and business goals of the company will be better addressed by recognizing risks and then suggesting suitable controls.
   
4. Accountability's and obligations for information protection should be made clear. An information protection group purpose statement and information protection policy statement must be made public for any program to be effective. The tasks and responsibilities of each employee should be specified in the policy. The policy language must be included in the purchase agreements for all contract employees and consultants in order for them to be fully functional.
   
5. Owners of systems are responsible for protecting information outside of their own business. Information is frequently accessible to people outside of the business unit or even the firm. The owner of the information is accountable (normally the senior-level manager in the business that created the information or the primary user of the information). Monitoring usage is a key duty to make sure it complies with the level of the authorization given to the user. If a system has external users, its owners have a duty to provide information about the existence and general scope of control mechanisms in a way that gives other users confidence that the system is sufficiently safe. The enterprise must have distinct and recognizable controls as the user base grows to include suppliers, vendors, clients, consumers, shareholders, and others. The first clue that restrictions are in place for many businesses is the sign-on screen. There should be three fundamental components on the message screen: The following information is provided: a. The system is exclusively for authorized users. b. Activities are monitored. c. By signing on, the user consents to the monitoring.
   
6. Information protection demands a thorough and coordinated strategy. Information protection concerns must be taken into consideration throughout the system development life cycle in order to be as successful as possible. Information protection should contain a risk analysis, a business effect study, and an information categorization document during the first or analysis phase. Additionally, because information is present in every department across the entire organization, each business unit should appoint a person to implement the information protection program in order to fulfill the department's unique business requirements. 
   
7. Reevaluating information protection should be done on a regular basis. Like anything else, the needs and goals change with time. A strong information protection program regularly evaluates itself and makes adjustments where and when they are required. It is necessary to review this procedure at least every 18 months because it is dynamic and ever-evolving.
   
8. The organizational culture has an impact on information protection. The ISSO needs to be aware that the fundamental information protection program will be applied across the board. However, flexibility to adapt to each business unit's unique requirements must be provided. If your company is multinational, you must make modifications for each of the different nations.

To make sure that the expense of restrictions does not outweigh the anticipated advantages, the cost and benefits of information protection should be carefully considered in both monetary and nonmonetary terms. Controls for information protection should be reasonable and proportionate.
