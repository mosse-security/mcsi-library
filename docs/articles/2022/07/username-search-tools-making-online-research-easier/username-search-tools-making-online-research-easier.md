# Username Search Tools Making Online Research Easier

Username details might connect to a lot more information during OSINT research since a particular username may be used as a login credential on other platforms. You can perform a manual search initially. However, it is hard to keep up with a ton of websites. At this point, you may need some tools to facilitate your research. In this blog post, we will take a look at five username search tools you can benefit from in OSINT operations.
