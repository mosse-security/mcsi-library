# Examples of Open Source and Closed Source Data
 
Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is gathered from publicly accessible data. As you might expect, OSINT entails having quick access to data kept on the internet as well as in other crowded places. In contrast to OSINT, closed source intelligence (CSINT) is information obtained from sources that are not open to the public. In this blog paper, we will examine various examples of open and closed data sources.

## Open Source Intelligence Examples

Let's have a look at some open source data examples.

**Commercial Newspaper archive**

Commercial resources, such as commercial newspaper archives or PEP lists, are classified as open source. Although you must pay to receive access, anybody may subscribe and gain access to the data.

**Internet search**

Internet search engines are the most popular approach to locating open-source material. Google, Bing, Yandex, and Baidu are a few examples.

**Dark Web**

The dark web is a cluster of web pages that you can only utilize using a specialized web browser such as TOR. It is used in both legal and illicit applications to make internet activity invisible and secret.

**Deep Web**

Data that cannot be accessed using standard search engines yet is available on the internet is frequently referred to as the "deep web." This includes records such as PEP lists, property registers, newspaper archives, and so forth.

**Breached databases**

Certain websites or other services allow you to search the released data. You can search for various identifiers such as username, email, number, passwords, and so on in leaked search engine repositories.

**Sanction Lists**

Sanctions lists contain individuals, groups, boats, banks, and corporations subject to government financial or legal sanctions.

## Closed Source Intelligence Examples

CSINT is considered closed since it needs a membership or purchase in some way, despite the fact that it is freely available and easy to access. In general, however, CSINT will likely make up just a tiny portion of a threat intelligence program. Closed source intelligence might be data shared with law enforcement or government entities as part of or as a consequence of current investigations.

Below are some examples of closed-source intelligence:

**Criminal records database**

Information that cannot be located using standard search engines yet is available on the internet is sometimes referred to as the "deep web." This includes datasets like Politically Exposed Persons lists (which are also abbreviated as PEP lists), land registers, newspaper archives, and so forth.

**Vehicle registration records**

A vehicle registry is a closed source of information that only law enforcement and other permitted governmental agencies have access to.

**Beneficial ownership register**

An increasing number of corporate registrations are available online, which may show an organization's beneficial ownership. Other resources include newspapers, organization websites, and web domain registration.
