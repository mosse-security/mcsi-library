# User and Entity Behavior Analytics UEBA
 
User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) is a cybersecurity system that uses algorithms and machine learning to detect anomalies in the behavior of corporate network routers, servers, and endpoints. UEBA aims to identify any unusual or suspicious behaviorâ€”instances where there are deviations from routine daily patterns of use. UEBA does more than just observe human behavior; it also observes machines. One day, a server in one branch office may receive thousands more requests than usual, indicating the beginning of a potential distributed denial-of-service (DDoS). It is possible that the IT administrator will not detect this sort of behavior, but UEBA will recognize it and take appropriate action.

## How Does User and Entity Behavior Analytics Work?

To be successful, a UEBA solution must be deployed on every device used by or linked to every employee within the firm. This covers devices owned not just by the corporation but also by the employee, as even gadgets used very occasionally might be targets of a cyberattack. Some firms may additionally require employees to install the UEBA solution on their home routers, which may act as attack vectors. Connecting to the business network using a home router expands the possibilities for a cyberattack.

The UEBA solution then "goes quiet," beginning to gather data on device and network usage. The UEBA solution's algorithms will establish and further define what is deemed normal or even optimum when in learning mode. IT administrators can specify how long the system will remain in learning mode before switching to testing mode.

A UEBA solution consists of three major components:
1.	Analytics gathers and organizes data on what it considers to be regular user and entity activity. The system creates profiles of how each person typically behaves in terms of application usage, communication and download activities, and network connectivity. Then, statistical models are developed and used to detect odd behavior. 
2.	Integration with existing security products and systems is essential as businesses develop and adapt. They almost certainly have a security stack in place, which may contain older systems that are unable to keep up with today's ever-changing threat landscape. The beauty of UEBA is that it is not intended to replace existing business security technologies. UEBA systems may compare data acquired from many sources, including logs, packet capture data, and other datasets, and combine them to make the system more resilient with correct integration. 
3.	Presentation is the process of expressing the UEBA system's results and developing a suitable response and this happens according to the organization. Some UEBA systems will merely provide an alert, either to the employee or to the IT administrator, recommending further inquiry. Other UEBA systems will be configured to take rapid action, such as instantly disconnecting network access for that employee in the event of a suspected cyberattack.

## UEBA Advantages: Why Do Businesses Need It?

Web gateways, firewalls, intrusion detection, and prevention systems, and encryption solutions like virtual private networks (VPNs) are traditional security measures that can no longer provide adequate protection. Sophisticated cyber attackers will find a way into a system, and detecting even the tiniest abnormality is critical.
Social engineering and phishing are also becoming more common. These techniques target an organization's people rather than its hardware, encouraging employees to click on links, download software, and transmit passwords. Infecting one machine is simply the beginning of what may be a large-scale hack. UEBA aims to identify even the most minor anomalies and prevent a little phishing campaign from growing into a huge data leak. Indeed, UEBA may have a significant influence on an organization's security posture
