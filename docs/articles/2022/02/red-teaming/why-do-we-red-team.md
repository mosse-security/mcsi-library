# Why do we Red Team?

Red teaming is a process where an organization uses security professionals to attack their systems in order to test their security defenses. It is commonly used in the military and government, as well as in the private sector.

## The Defenders Perspective

Red Team operations provides a promising approach that can help improve both the speed and quality of incident response capabilities.

The Red Team should share their knowledge and insights with the Blue Team. Overall, it provides the Blue Team with a different perspective, which can be helpful in solving problems. Ultimately, this would lead to a more secure organization.

## The Benefits of Cyber Red Teaming

1. The Red Team can help an organization improve its defensive posture by identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in the organization's security infrastructure.

2. The Red Team can help an organization better understand its adversary, including their tactics, techniques, and procedures.

3. The Red Team can help an organization assess its readiness for a potential cyber-attack.

4. The Red Team can help an organization improve its incident response plan by identifying potential gaps in the plan.

## The Risks and Limitations of Cyber Red Teaming

Red team operations are not without risk, however. They can be expensive, and can also lead to bruised egos and conflict within organizations. It is important to carefully weigh the benefits against the risks before undertaking a red team operation.

Another limitation is that red team operations tend to be relatively small-scale operations. They are designed to provide a provocation through which participants can examine risks and examine their own responses. While this type of training is invaluable, it doesn't allow for the simulation of ongoing attack campaigns by an advanced threat actor.

There are also legal considerations to keep in mind. Many states have laws that regulate what information can be obtained from whom, and how it can be used. Because of this, it is important to ensure that the information provided by the Red Team is not legally actionable.
