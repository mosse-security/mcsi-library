# Why do we do incident response?

Incident response is a process that organizations use to manage and mitigate the damage of a security incident. The primary goal of incident response is to protect the organization's assets and minimize the disruption caused by the incident. There is no single definition of an incident, but most experts agree that an incident is a security event that has the potential to cause harm to the organization. Incidents can include events such as a data breach, a ransomware attack, or a malicious email campaign. Incident response is a critical part of any organization's security strategy.

By having a well-defined process in place, organizations can quickly respond to security incidents and minimize the damage that they cause.

## The need for an incident response (IR) plan

IR plans should be in place before an incident occurs, and should be tailored to the specific needs of the organization.

There are many reasons why an organization should have an incident response plan. Perhaps the most important reason is that incidents can have a serious impact on an organization's ability to function. A well-executed IR plan can help minimize the damage caused by an incident, and can help get the organization back up and running as quickly as possible. Another reason to have an IR plan is that it can help protect an organization's reputation. A well-executed IR plan can prevent or mitigate the damage that can be caused by a security incident, and can help an organization maintain its reputation as a reliable, secure, and trustworthy business. Finally, having an IR plan can help an organization comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Many organizations are required to have an IR plan in order to comply with data protection laws or other regulations.

## The Incident Response Process

The incident response process typically includes the following steps:

1. Identification of the incident
2. Containment of the incident
3. Eradication of the incident
4. Recovery of the affected systems
5. Preventing a similar incident in the future

## Planning for a major cyber incident

Organizations plan for incident response in order to prevent, mitigate, and respond to potential incidents. Planning helps ensure that the organization is prepared to handle an incident if it occurs. Organizational planning for incident response typically includes the following:

1. Establishing incident response procedures and protocols
2. Designating incident response teams
3. Identifying incident response resources
4. Developing and practicing incident response plans

Incident response procedures and protocols establish how the organization will respond to specific types of incidents. They include the steps that will be taken to prevent, mitigate, and respond to an incident. Incident response teams are responsible for responding to incidents. They typically include representatives from different departments within the organization, such as information technology, legal, human resources, and marketing.

## Conclusion

Incidents happen. They can be small and contain little impact, or they can be large and cause catastrophic damage. Regardless of the size or the impact, all incidents must be responded to.

There are many reasons why we do incident response. The most important reason, however, is to protect our organizations and our customers. By responding to incidents quickly and efficiently, we can minimize the damage that is done and help to get our organizations back up and running as quickly as possible. Another reason for doing incident response is to learn from our mistakes. By investigating and analyzing incidents, we can identify the root causes and learn from them so that we can improve our security posture and help to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
