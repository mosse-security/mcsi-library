# What is the difference between Red Teaming, Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Assessments?

There are three primary ways that organizations test the security of their networks: red teaming, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments. Each has its own unique strengths and weaknesses, and each is suited for different purposes.

## What is Red Teaming?

Red Teaming is the name given to a specific type of testing, where the ethical hacker adopts the role of an adversary. The purpose of Red Teaming is to identify an organizationâ€™s weak points before a real attacker can find and exploit them. Unlike a regular penetration test, which is focused on demonstrating how an attacker could break into a system, Red Teaming is all about simulating a real-world attack **to the very end**.

Red Teaming goes beyond simply identifying vulnerabilities; it also includes intelligence gathering, social engineering, and other tactics that an attacker might use. This makes it an invaluable tool for organizations that want to improve their security posture.

Red Team Operations involve a lot more _human intelligence_ (i.e. planning, critical thinking, project management) than traditional penetration test.

Whereas a penetration tester might take a "brute force" approach to identifying security vulnerabilities, red teamers are more likely to take a "surgical" approach, identifying and exploiting specific weaknesses. Red teaming also entails a greater focus on _communication_ and _cooperation_ with other parts of the organization, in order to get the most out of limited resources.

## What is Penetration Testing?

Penetration Testing is the process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems or networks. Penetration Testing is often used to assess the security of systems and networks, but it can also be used to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Penetration testing is also used to evaluate the extent of the damage that could be caused by a real attack.

Penetration testing is a dynamic, rigorous process of verifying the security of an information system by attacking its defenses. It typically lasts 5-10 days, and uses both a predefined checklist of items as well as creative methods to probe for vulnerabilities.

Industry-standard tools are typically favored by testers instead of custom tools, though rare exceptions do exist. This is due to the fact that industry tools offer comprehensive support for various testing needs, whereas custom tools may not be as well rounded. In addition, custom tools may require more work to maintain and keep up to date.

## What are Vulnerability Assessments?

A vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying vulnerabilities in systems or networks using automated tools.

A vulnerability assessment typically begins with an inventory of devices and systems. The assessment then proceeds to identifying potential vulnerabilities in these systems. This may include identifying open ports, testing for weak passwords, and looking for known exploits.

Once vulnerabilities are identified, the next step is to determine the risk associated with each vulnerability. This may include assessing the impact of an exploit and the likelihood of an exploit occurring.

The final step is to develop a plan to address the vulnerabilities. This may include patch management, configuration changes, or other countermeasures.

Compared to penetration testing and red teaming, vulnerability assessments are simpler and faster. They focus exclusively on device vulnerabilities, and do not assess the effectiveness of security procedures and personnel.
