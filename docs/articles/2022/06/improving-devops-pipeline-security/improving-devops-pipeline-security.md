# Improving DevOps Pipeline Security


DevOps is more than tools. It is also securing our environment from the very start. In this blog article, we will discuss how we can secure our DevOps pipeline.

## How to create a safe DevOps infrastructure?

Below are some recommendations to assist you to handle security concerns and create a more robust environment in your company.

### Adopt a DevSecOps mindset

Implementing a DevSecOps methodology is crucial for current DevOps implementation. As a result, it is critical to integrate security into an enterprise's existing culture. This may be accomplished by creating good cooperation and interaction across the development, administration, and cybersecurity teams. Although most companies have security procedures, they must be followed for more than just compliance with legislation and requirements. Rather, personnel should cross-train and enhance their skills in order to adopt a DevSecOps strategy and include security early in the development process.

Security professionals should learn how to write code and leverage APIs, whereas programmers should learn security and utilize automation to do this.

### Set up access control

The principle of least privilege (PoLP) is what you need to execute for a stronger security strategy, which implies you should make an extra effort to offer individuals only the privileges they need to perform their job, but nothing more.

### Shift-left

Shifting left involves incorporating security into software at an earlier phase of development. This implies that security specialists must collaborate carefully with developers to ensure that safe software is built from the outset. The security function should not only do assessments but should also collaborate with programmers and designers to create a security-hardened architecture and program.

### Control security threats

You should acknowledge the risks that are unavoidable and have a standard operating procedure (SOP) in place in the event of an attack. From a security viewpoint, you should have simple and understandable rules and procedures in all levels of software building and system management, like revision control, access management, vulnerability scanning, software testing, and implementation of firewalls.

### Conduct vulnerability scanning

Today, open-source software is exploding, and most programming models rely on fully prepared libraries, open-source frameworks, and third-party software which do not provide any form of warranty or accountability. Whereas the open-source environment is reshaping the technical world more than ever, it also has flaws that you don't want to inherit into your program. Vulnerability assessment is critical since it may detect a potential third-party dependency with flaws and inform you at a preliminary phase.

### Automation

Security should not slow down your DevOps workgroups, so consider incorporating security into your CI/CD workflows to stay up with the quick pace of DevOps.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we discussed how we can improve our DevOps infrastructures with the help of the right mindset, code review, vulnerability analysis, infrastructure management, and system scanning. We should always make sure that only approved and reliable software is delivered. We also learned that automation aids in the early detection of possible weaknesses in the software development life cycle (SDLC), lowering the development cost and rewriting. These recommended practices will aid in the successful management of security concerns.
