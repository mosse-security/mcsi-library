# Wireless attacks
 

Any malicious attack that targets a wireless network or devices that utilise wireless technology is known as a wireless attack. Wireless assaults can be used to get unwanted access to sensitive information or to impair a wireless network's normal operation. Wireless assaults come in a variety of forms, some of which are given below.

## War Driving

Most people are aware with the phrase "hacking," but they may be unaware that hacking does not necessarily necessitate the use of a computer. War driving, which is the act of driving about hunting for unsecured wireless networks, is one of the most prevalent methods of hacking. While war driving may appear to be innocuous, it may be really deadly. That's because when someone war drives, they're seeking for a means to get access to another person's network without their consent. They can do anything they want once they're on the network, including stealing sensitive data or planting malware. Of course, not every war driver is a bad guy.

## War Chalking

War chalking is one of the most popular wireless attacks. The attacker leaves chalk marks on sidewalks or buildings to indicate the location of a wireless network in this attack. The attacker will normally post a phone number or email address so that individuals who wish to join to the network may contact them. War chalking is a low-tech attack that may be quite successful. It's also pretty simple to counter. Wipe away any odd chalk markings if you notice them. You may also keep a look out in your area for war chalking and report it to the authorities if you see it.

## IV Attack

An IV attack is a wireless assault that takes advantage of a flaw in the way some encryption methods operate. An attacker can derive the key used to encrypt the data by utilizing a known plaintext and a chosen ciphertext. This form of attack is particularly hazardous since it may be used to both decrypt and encrypt material that has already been encrypted. The WEP encryption scheme was the target of one of the most well-known IV attacks.

## WiFi Disassociation Attack

WiFi disassociation is a form of denial-of-service attack that prohibits a genuine user from connecting to a wireless network. Disassociation frames are sent by an attacker to a target wireless client, which causes it to disassociate from the wireless access point. This attack can be used to prevent users from connecting to a wireless network or to disrupt communication between users and wireless devices.

This attack can be used to prevent users from connecting to a wireless network or to disrupt communication between users and wireless devices.

## Brute Force Attack

A brute force attack is a sort of password assault in which a hacker attempts various combinations of characters to guess the password. When the attacker has no additional knowledge regarding the target's password, this sort of attack is commonly utilized. Using a strong password that is difficult to guess is one of the most popular techniques to avoid a brute force assault. Two-factor authentication, which requires the user to have two distinct pieces of information in order to log in, is another technique to avoid this sort of attack. If you suspect you've been the victim of a brute force attack, change your password right away and use two-factor authentication if it's available.

## Final Words

In conclusion, wireless assaults are clearly a genuine and present threat. With the widespread use of wireless devices and networks, it is more vital than ever to be aware of the hazards and take precautions to protect oneself. You may lower your chance of being a victim of a wireless attack by following a few easy actions, and by doing so, you can assist to keep yourself and your data secure.
