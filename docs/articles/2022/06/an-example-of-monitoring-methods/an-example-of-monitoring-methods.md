# An Example of Monitoring Methods
 
Cybersecurity breaches are prevalent, and numerous occur in corporations on a daily basis. While some incursions may be considered modest, many are severe with minimal monetary or data damage. Some are even disastrous. Network security monitoring is a technique that automatically analyses network devices and traffic for security flaws, threats, and suspicious activity. It can help organisations discover and respond to cybersecurity incidents fast.

## Signature-based monitoring

Every malware has a distinct signature (a distinct string of bits, cryptic hash, or binary pattern) that may be used as a fingerprint to identify that virus. Most antivirus systems have used signature-based malware detection as their primary weapon against malware-laden infiltration attempts from the beginning of time. Anti-malware software would scan all data entering a system to see whether the source code or hashes in the files or packets matched any of the known malware threats. Signature-based detection approaches were straightforward for security providers to install and update. All anti-malware companies kept a library of known and discovered threats for this purpose. The efficiency and accuracy of these software solutions were tested by the vendor's ability to incorporate new signatures and push them to client computers, as well as the vendor's total number of malware signatures. This approach offers great and dependable defence against millions of known and current threats.

## Anomaly-based monitoring (ABM)

Monitoring that looks for odd or unexpected behaviour is known as anomaly-based monitoring (ABM). It's frequently used to detect security threats or illegal access. ABM can track network traffic, system performance, and even individual user activities. It is usually used in conjunction with other monitoring approaches, such as rule-based monitoring, which searches for certain occurrences or situations. ABM is capable of identifying a wide range of threats, but it may also produce false positives. As a result, ABM systems must be properly tuned to prevent overloading security professionals with too many alarms. When utilised correctly, ABM may be a very effective tool for detecting and responding to security issues.

## Behavior-based monitoring

Behavior-based network monitoring is a sort of network monitoring that examines the behaviour of network devices rather than their individual condition. By observing behaviour, it is possible to uncover trends and potential issues that might otherwise go unnoticed. Behavior-based network monitoring is often based on agent software that operates on each network device. This agent programme monitors the device's activities and reports it to a central server. The central server then examines the activity of all network devices to seek for trends. One advantage of using behavior-based network monitoring is that it can discover issues that would otherwise go undetected. For example, if a gadget behaves in an unusual manner.

Digitization is no longer a competitive advantage or a wise choice for today's organisations; it is a need. However, as more businesses undertake digital transformation, the number of cybersecurity assaults increases. IT teams may provide each employee, partner, or contractor the appropriate amount of access to business resources based on device, user profiles, network, or even geography. Centralized IT administration and access control policies enable the firm to avoid data loss, preserve privacy, and protect assets, while complete real-time monitoring and reporting aid in compliance efforts.
