# Securing the Internet of Things IoT Devices
 

It's critical for security analysts to grasp the substantial influence IoT devices can have on expanding a company's attack surface. As companies place greater trust in smart devices to provide insight into their resources, they must take extra care to safeguard their systems and ensure the authenticity, validity, and accessibility of the data that travels across them.

## What is IoT?

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected smart devices, mechanical and digital machines, and items that have unique IDs and the capacity to send information over a network without any need for human contact. The Internet of Things has provided adversaries with the main channel via which to launch an attack. Frequently, IoT device makers include IoT capabilities without properly analyzing the security problems of such technology or even without including any protective measures to secure the IoT technologies.

## Different instances of IoT devices

IoT deployments encompass a multitude of devices, however, they are essentially classified into five categories:

- Smart home devices: These are goods used in the house. These products are intended for home automation and administration.

- Business automation: Business automation in IoT refers to technologies that automate and control enterprises' heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), lighting, access control, and fire alarm system.

- Wearable technology devices: These are goods that people wear.

- Connected cars: Connected vehicles have internet connectivity and data sharing transmission capabilities.
- Smart cities: These technologies contain systems that aid in the resolution of traffic congestion concerns as well as the reduction of environmental issues. Smart energy, smart transportation, smart data, smart architecture, and smart mobility products are among them.

Now letâ€™s discuss what we can do to secure IoT technologies.

## How to Secure IoT Device

Security experts must be aware of the many ways for safeguarding IoT devices. Several suggestions are as follows:

- You should first start with securing and unifying access logs.
- To ensure reliable communications, you must use encrypted networking protocols.

- You should also close unneeded ports and turn off any unrequired services.
- You must ensure that IoT devices should not be directly accessible to unauthorized access.

### IoT security and passwords

Manufacturers frequently deploy smart devices with default, static, or readily guessable passwords. When this is combined with the fact that many of them ship with services that are vulnerable to remote access, these devices become a target for attackers executing automated tools for mass exploits. IoT devices with default passwords and services have been scanned, attacked, and utilized in many ways. After gaining access to them, criminals install malware and maintain communication with them in order to construct massive groups of centrally controlled devices capable of committing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, data theft, and wide-scale spam.

- You must develop powerful yet applicable password policies.
- Set up virtual local area networks (LAN) and enforce stringent communication systems regulations.
- Install and update device firmware on a routine basis depending on manufacturer instructions.
- Be careful with choosing which IoT technologies to employ in our organization. A specific vendor may be superior to others in designing for privacy and security.

## Conclusion

IoT devices are highly targeted by malicious actors for various reasons as we covered in this blog page. Now you are capable of securing IoT technologies by following the guideline suggested above.
