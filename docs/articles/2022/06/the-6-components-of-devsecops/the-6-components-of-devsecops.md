# The 6 components of DevSecOps
 

When you are doing security in DevOps, the first challenge waiting for you is how to be as quick as possible. In this blog post we will discuss why we should implement DevSecOps to ensure that security can keep up with the pace of our project and what are it's components. Letâ€™s begin remembering the most important objective of DevSecOps...

## Introduction

The primary goal of a DevSecOps approach is to incorporate application security throughout the production cycle along with blending agile development methodologies with continuous delivery and continuous integration technologies. So how does it achieve this?

## How DevSecOps achieve security standards?

DevSecOps is an effective bridge between teams.
The DevSecOps approach includes security in the whole development and deployment process right from the very start. DevSecOps builds effective communication between various departments such as operation, security, development, and administration teams. A natural result of effective communication between multiple departments is security implementations in all teams such as ops, devs, testing teams, and IT admins. In this manner, the time to launch may be drastically reduced without sacrificing safety.

## Using the DevSecOps approach

The DevSecOps technique includes six key components:

### Code Analysis

You distribute the code granularly so that flaws can be identified immediately.

### Compliance Auditing

You are prepared for an audit at any time.

### Change

Enabling modifications to originate from every source (such as different teams) increases overall excellence, speed, and efficiency. Afterward, an assessment process determines if these modifications are acceptable or need further revision.

### Vulnerability Assessment

Using code analysis, pen-testing, and architectural analysis, recognize additional flaws and thereafter you can evaluate what is the response and how to fix timelines.

### Threat Analysis

You should adapt to new dependencies, new threats and respond them quickly at each granular code updates.

### Security and team Education

You should implement effective security principles in platforms and educate your development staff.

It is crucial to highlight that these concepts are primarily the responsibility of the security department, but one of the most important DevSecOps principles is to desegregate security and it becomes just another need in the development and deployment pipeline.

## Importance of DevSecOps methodologies

These methods desegregate security, making it a part of the workflow rather than something reserved for the security team. Through the implementation of the DevSecOps approach, robust structures are constructed, and cybersecurity becomes yet another aspect of the organization's existing culture.

## Conclusion

As you have learned, security procedures are already implemented into the initial stages of development using the DevSecOps approach. Increasing the security level by adopting the appropriate measures from the beginning rather than deploying them as a security patch on an already finished product provides a solid architecture for your softwares, business solutions.
