# Introduction to the DevSecOps Environment 

Let's learn about what a DevSecOps is.

## Components of DevSecOps

DevSecOps is made up of three tiers:

### Culture

Although this is not a technical component, it is sometimes overlooked that DevOps involves far more than using tools and building CI/CD pipelines. Clearly, the same remains true for DevSecOps. Each group member in DevSecOps is accountable for its protection and behaves accordingly. However, this does not imply that cybersecurity professionals are outdated. It's a good idea to have a security expert or professional on the team, also known as the security champion.

_The Security Champion_ is responsible for overseeing all procedures related to the implementation of security guidelines and requirements, as well as assuring compliance.

### Security by design

Security is built into all layers of the platform. It usually indicates that an organization has an outlined structure that encompasses all areas of security and imposes protection stances on frameworks, including verification, access control, secrecy, the integrity of data, responsibility, and accessibility, as well as restoration and remedial action when systems are attacked. Every time software engineers design and construct new apps or functionalities; the security-focused mindset is adopted from the start. Security architecture, systems, policies, and regulations are all controlled centrally.

### Automation

In DevSecOps, we aim to apply automation as much as possible, especially in security. The motivation for automating security is to avoid human failure while also having automated mechanisms where code is examined for security flaws or non-compliant elements like unlicensed programs. The security manager is also in charge of security automation, but he or she works with the staff.

Automation also entails automatic audits and collecting proof in the event of an attack or intrusion. Following that, the automated process ensures that security measurements are captured and provided back to the DevSecOps practice for an evaluation. As an example, if a vulnerability in the code is detected or a license is violated during the scan, information will be gathered and submitted for further review.

## DevSecOps methodology of layer management

DevSecOps focuses on the following components to manage different layers:

- Harvesting repositories
- Code security
- Cloud environment security
- Vulnerability assessments and tests

Lastly, we will make a comparison between DevSecOps and SECaaS.

## DevSecOps and SECaaS

DevSecOps and security as a service are two different things. SECaaS can be part of the DevSecOps methodology, although the notion of SECaaS is primarily concerned with moving security as a duty to a service supplier. This is a sourcing framework that helps organizations obtain cybersecurity on a recurring basis from a supplier.

### Why SECaaS?

There are several compelling reasons to deploy SECaaS, one of which is that a supplier is accountable for all security upgrades in accordance with the recent findings.

Service-level agreements for incident response periods and the early implementation of security procedures can be defined by businesses. It may be incorporated into DevSecOps. However, SECaaS also implies that an organization must rely on a service provider to install and maintain the security status.

## Summary

In this blog post we tried to create a picture of the DevSecOps environment, and it's major components. We also covered how it handles the 3 layers of DevSecOps: culture, automation and security by design. And at the last part we touched upon similarities and differences of DevSecOps and SECaaS. Now you have a clear image of what is development, security, and operations.
