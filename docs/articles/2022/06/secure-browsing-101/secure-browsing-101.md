# Secure Browsing 101
 
A secure browser is the first line of defense against online threats. There are a few simple steps you can take to ensure your safety while online.In this blog article, we will discuss the basics of how to safely use web browsers. Upon completion of this blog post, you'll learn how you can browse the internet securely and protect your personal information.

## Shared devices risks

Never keep your password on a shared device. Keep a password in a browser only on a device that you own.

Sign in to services only when absolutely required from a shared computer. Consider updating your passwords once you return to your personal computer. Whenever you're using a public device, ensure to sign out or lock the screen if you walk away or carry your machine with you.

## Secure e-mail passwords

Your email password must never be saved. You may be authorized with SSO for some applications. Other programs can be linked to your e-mail account as well. If an attacker gains control of your email password, he or she will be able to simply change all of your other credentials associated with your email account.

As you can see, MFA is always an additional layer of security. Additional password protection solutions, such as two-factor authentication and a password vault should be used.

## Control your personal workstation

You should always keep your device near you or in a safe area, and never keep it open when not being used.

## Use incognito mode

Take advantage of being anonymous. If you really must access a personal account from a shared computer, use incognito mode to reduce the data kept in the browser tab. Once you conclude your session, ensure to sign out and exit the browser entirely. Unfortunately, public machines are always dangerous, even if you sign out or use incognito mode since malicious code might collect your keyboard inputs or other data.

## Set up lock screen time appropriately

Configure your lock screen to activate in a few minutes to reduce the period of time your machine is accessible if you forget to lock it.

## Use strong passwords, even for lock screens

We've already discussed customized wordlists like `SecLists`, `wordlistctl`, and `rockyou.txt`. Examine these lists to obtain a feel of the types of passwords to avoid. As a result, whenever you sign in to your machine, choose a strong password or passphrase instead of something simple like abc123, so that others cannot simply open your machine if it is left unattended.

## Conclusion

It takes a few wise steps to secure yourself when using web browsers, but it's critical to identify how to combine ease with protection. Saving all of your passwords in your browser may seem easy since you don't have to write them in, but it also indicates that anyone with access to that machine may obtain your passwords and credentials. You must establish the right combination between safety and convenience, both in the physical and virtual worlds.
