# AWS - Five Pillars of a Well-Architected Framework 
 

As a leading cloud provider, AWS has developed five pillars that define a well-architected framework. These include security, reliability, performance, cost management, and operational excellence. Learn more about these pillars and how they apply to your organization.

## What are the key points of the five pillars?

### Security

Security should always be a top consideration in both on-premises and cloud infrastructures. Encrypting and preserving data, access control, security architecture, surveillance, and intrusion detection and investigation are all important components of security to consider.

AWS proposes the following design principles to enable system security and protect against malicious actors and vulnerabilities:

- Constantly allow for backtracking.
- Adopt the least privilege rule.
- Protect the infrastructure in-depth, including the application layer, database layer, OS, and hardware layers.
- Apply automation for optimal protection.

### Reliability

Another feature of a well-designed framework is the reduction or removal of single points of failure (SPOF). Preferably, each item must have a backup. This backup should be created online and automatically without the need for human interaction.
While utilizing AWS resources that are not maintained by AWS, use a similar strategy to minimize data loss and service disruption.

To improve dependability, here are some suggestions on design principles:

- Test backup and recovery procedures on a regular basis.
- Create self-recovering systems from a single component failure.
- When possible, scale up to improve general uptime.
- To avoid resource constraints, use automation to provide and shut down resources based on traffic and consumption.

### Performance efficiency

AWS offers a number of tools and services to aid in the development of high-efficiency infrastructures. We must still verify that the architectures we create are effective and scaled for our applications.

When it comes to performance efficiency, the following design best practices are suggested:

- Make cutting-edge technology more accessible.
- Use AWS's global infrastructure to distribute your application internationally at a cheap cost and with low delay.
- Wherever practical, use serverless systems.
- Test different settings to find which one performs best.

### Cost optimization

AWS allows you to enable tracking systems that will immediately shut down services that are not being used. This is particularly beneficial in development and testing situations.

Several principles are offered to improve cost optimization:

- Employ a consumption model.
- When possible, take advantage of economies of scale.
- Cut prices by restricting the usage of corporations' data centers.
- Analyze and account for technology expenses on a regular basis.
- If feasible, employ AWS-managed resources rather than self-managed services. This should reduce your administrative costs.

### Operational excellence

Workload operational excellence should be assessed across the following dimensions:

- Agility
- Reliability
- Performance

The best strategy to maximize these KPIs is to unify and automate workload management. AWS suggests the following approaches for delivering exceptional operational performance:

- Adopt infrastructure as code (IAAC).
- Integrate operations and technologies with company needs and goals.
- Modify your systems gradually and on a routine basis.
- Test both typical and abnormal circumstances on a regular basis.
- Document the insights acquired from operational incidents and mistakes.
- Document and update up-to-date standard operating standards guidelines.

## Summary

To review, we have covered the main points, system architecture principles, and best practice guidelines for developing and delivering cloud workloads that make up the Well-Architected Framework. You should regularly analyze your systems to verify that you adhere to the suggested guidelines of the AWS Well-Architected Framework as well as complying with architectural best practices.
