# Build a Safe Testing Environment for Suspicious Files and URL's
 

Sandboxing is a technique in which you build an isolated test environment, or "sandbox," in which you execute or "detonate" a suspicious file or URL attached to an email. The sandbox should be a safe, virtual environment that closely mimics the CPU of your production servers. 

Sandboxing is very good at protecting against zero-day attacks. Emails are scanned for known dangerous senders, URLs, and file types using traditional inbound email filters. Unfortunately, thousands of new (or "zero-day") dangers emerge every day that email filters have yet to detect. Sandboxing, a fundamental component of advanced threat prevention, adds an extra layer of safety by allowing any email that comes through the email filter but still contains unknown URL links, file kinds, or senders to be evaluated before reaching your network or mail server.

## The Benefits of Sandboxing

There are several advantages to using a sandbox:

* Doesn't put your hosts' or operating systems' systems at risk. The fundamental benefit of sandboxing is that it keeps your host devices and operating systems safe from malicious software.

* Check for hazards in possibly dangerous software. You can evaluate new software for dangers before adopting it if you're working with new suppliers or untrustworthy software sources.
Run software modifications through their paces before they go online. If you're writing new code, you can use sandboxing to test it for vulnerabilities before releasing it.

* Contain zero-day threats in quarantine. You can isolate and eradicate zero-day threats via sandboxing.

* Work in tandem with existing security measures. Sandboxing is a method that works in conjunction with your other security products and policies to provide you with even more protection.

Sandboxing is a powerful and useful protection tactic, but it has two significant flaws.
Sandboxing takes a lot of effort and resources. It's impracticable and expensive to run all of your digital traffic via a sandboxing system.

It is possible to get around sandboxing. As sandboxing grew more prevalent, fraudsters sought to create malware with characteristics that would allow them to elude detection. For example, danger may be engineered to lay dormant until a later date, making it look innocuous during sandboxing. Another excellent evasive strategy is to build malware capable of detecting if it is in a virtual environment and remaining dormant until it is on a real desktop or another device.

## What is the significance of sandboxing?

Because the number and effectiveness of zero-day attacks are increasing all the time, you need a plan in place to defend your data and applications from threats that get past standard email, malware, and virus filters. Sandboxing is one of the most effective strategies for keeping hackers at bay. There are cloud-based sandboxing solutions that provide excellent protection without compromising network speed or making your network vulnerable to cunning hackers.

## Final Words

Sandboxing may be approached in a variety of ways, and the ideal technique for you will ultimately rely on your needs and tastes. The advice in this article, on the other hand, should help you get off to a good start. You should be able to discover a sandboxing solution that works well for you and helps you enhance your productivity with a little amount of experimenting.
