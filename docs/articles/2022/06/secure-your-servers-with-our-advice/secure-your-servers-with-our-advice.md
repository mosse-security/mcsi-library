# Secure Your Servers With Our Advice

Servers need particular security implementations, because obtaining the information stored on the servers is the most profitable objective for an attacker. This blog post will help you secure your servers with simple and clear guidelines.

## How can I secure my servers?

Several servers may be active in an organization's network. These servers provide information into the organization's users. The following are some suggestions to keep your most valuable assets, network servers, and the data it stores from attackers.

- Secure Physical access: First and foremost, you must secure physical access to your servers.
  
- Access Control: Restrict access to a server's common resources to only authorized individuals with the least privilege. Prevent unauthorized personnel from gaining access to confidential documents.

- Encrypt Credentials: Since servers are regularly used for user authentication, you must encrypt the credentials for the server.
  
- Use Firewalls: Implement multiple network access firewalls to restrict traffic to the server

- Segment your Network: Construct secure network segmentation using subnets and create multiple domains for various types of servers.

- Monitor and log events: You should regularly check essential server resources to detect possible issues.

- Manage your OS effectively: The operating system is the most significant server software component. This includes installing, setting, and managing the server operating system and software packages chosen for usage on the server in a safe manner. You must install the OS according to the manufacturer's instructions. You must also update and patch your OS regularly. New security risks are generated on a daily basis. Implement fixes and updates before it is lve and running. Stop or remove all unnecessary services, apps, and protocols.

- Regulatory Compliance: Strengthen the OS in order to fulfill the security procedures of the company. Download and set up any third-party security measures necessary to satisfy the security rules of your enterprise. You may install and configure tools for network security solutions such as anti-malware software, EDR products, host (server)-based IDPS, and firewalls. You may also want to use encryption software to secure data at rest from unauthorized access even if an attacker gains actual access to the server.

- Perform vulnerability scans: Test the security level of your servers to confirm that it satisfies all your company's security needs. You can employ vulnerability scanning and penetration detection technologies to assess the server's security mechanisms. You must perform these scans repeatedly throughout the server's lifespan to guarantee that its security capabilities are sufficient.

## Conclusion

Network servers are among the most appealing objectives for attackers. Upon completion of this blog, you are now provided with various strong suggestions to keep network servers with operating systems and applications secure.
