# An Example of Authentication Attacks


Authentication attacks try to guess the correct username and password. Brute Force attacks, the most basic type of authentication attack, aim to acquire access to an account by attempting random passwords. Threat actors utilize algorithms to automate this process, which can result in millions of passwords guesses every day.

Unfortunately, not every system is well protected against authentication threats. However, here are some frequent symptoms that might assist you in determining whether your account is in jeopardy.

Some systems have safeguards in place to prevent too many incorrect password attempts on a user account. One of these systems is now allowing additional password tries for a limited time. This might be the reason you are unable to log in to your account. There are technologies that can discern between 'regular' and 'abnormal' login activities. For example, if you usually log in from Australia and on that same day a machine located in Albania tries to log in to your account, you might get an alert via email.

If you are confident that you are inputting the proper password, but it no longer works, it is possible that someone has entered your account and changed your password. You should immediately try to reclaim your account, either using the 'I forgot my password' option or by contacting the application's support.

In today's internet world, authentication assaults are a hidden but rising concern. Few people are aware of the threat, and even fewer understand the dire ramifications. We have the mistaken belief that we are anonymous behind our smartphones or computers, and that we can just switch them off to escape any risk. Our lives are gradually but steadily becoming more interwoven online.

You may be unaware that the amount of authentication attacks in the security environment is rising. Worse, the source of these assaults is always shifting, making it impossible to block these networks without disrupting routine traffic and connections.

## Brute Force Attacks

The most prevalent form that people are aware of is brute force authentication assaults. This method tries every conceivable combination of letters, numbers, and symbols to crack passwords. Brute force attacks are less successful against online service accounts because these services typically have safeguards in place to prevent a high frequency of password tries in a short period of time. A lengthy password is the most secure against brute force assaults. A strong password has at least one lower case, one upper case, one number, and one symbol. A strong 6-character password can be broken in 5 seconds, an 8-character password can be cracked in 8 hours, and a 12-character password can be cracked in 34,000 years.

## Dictionary Attacks

Another sort of authentication attack is a dictionary attack. Don't be confused by the term; a 'dictionary' assault does not use a dictionary in the strict sense; it refers to any set of passwords. To boost the possibilities of cracking passwords, a predetermined list of words is utilised instead of testing every conceivable combination. If you look for the most frequent passwords, you can be confident that any password on such lists will be broken instantaneously. Use a password that is not a single dictionary word, and ensure that your password is not on a list of the most often used passwords.

## Password Spraying Attacks

Dictionary attacks have been improved into password spraying attacks. Limiting the number of times, a password may be entered for a certain account within a set time range is a typical security mechanism on most systems. Password spraying prevents being 'locked out' by attempting a limited number of passwords across many accounts, avoiding alarms and suspicion. For example, an attack may try three different passwords on 100 separate accounts of a certain service (your account being one of them).

## Credential Stuffing Attacks

Credential stuffing attacks are the last but not least. These attacks make advantage of real-world login and password combinations. These lists are the result of an increasing number of data breaches, some of which include valid login and password information. Credential stuffing attacks use this information to hack into accounts that have not reset their passwords following a data leak. They will also try these username and password combinations across all services in order to take advantage of the fact that some users use the same login and password for several accounts.

You may find out if your account has ever been a victim of a data breach by visiting haveibeenpwned.com. If it has, if you haven't already, replace your password right away. Also, don't use the same login and password for several services. This may appear to be a simple approach to eliminate the need to memorise your credentials, but it significantly weakens the efficacy of your protection.
