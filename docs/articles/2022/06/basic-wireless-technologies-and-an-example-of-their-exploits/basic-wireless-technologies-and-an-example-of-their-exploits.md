# Basic Wireless Technologies and an Example of their Exploits
 

Wireless technologies allow two or more devices to interact without the use of physical touch or a connected connection. Mobile phones, computer networking, wireless sensor networks, and other applications use wireless technology. There are a variety of wireless technologies available, each with its own set of benefits and drawbacks. Bluetooth, WiFi, and infrared are the most prevalent wireless technologies. Bluetooth is a wireless communication technology that allows two devices to connect over a short distance. Bluetooth is found in a variety of devices, including cell phones, headsets, and wireless keyboards and mouse.

## What are the benefits of wireless technology?

In recent years, wireless technology has advanced significantly. There are several sorts of wireless technologies accessible today, each with its own set of benefits. Listed below are a few of the advantages of wireless technology:
Wireless technologies eliminate the need for cords and wires, allowing you to connect devices without them. This may be a big help in circumstances where you need to be able to move around freely or when there aren't a lot of outlets.

Increased Productivity: Wireless technology may enable people work from anyplace, which can help them be more productive. Workers, for example, may carry their laptops with them and connect to the internet from anyplace, whether at work, at home, or on the road.

## An example of wireless technologies

### Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)

RFID is a wireless technology that transfers data between devices using radio waves. Contactless payments, asset tracking, and security are just a few of the applications for RFID. Contactless payment methods like Apple Pay and Google Wallet employ RFID technology. Asset tracking systems also employ RFID technology. Assets including as equipment, tools, and pallets may all be fitted with RFID tags. Real-time asset tracking is possible using RFID asset monitoring systems. Inventory levels can also be tracked using RFID tags. Security applications make advantage of RFID technology. People, cars, and assets may all be tracked with RFID tags.

### Near Field Communication (NFC)

Near Field Communication has recently gained traction in the public. When two devices are near enough together, NFC allows them to interact without the use of an intermediary device. NFC is already being utilized in a variety of applications. Contactless payment systems, such as Apple Pay and Android Pay, are one of the most widespread. When two cell phones are connected together for file sharing, NFC may be used to exchange data between them. In comparison to other wireless technologies, NFC provides a number of benefits. It uses extremely little energy, therefore it doesn't deplete batteries as rapidly as other wireless technologies.

## How can wireless technology be exploited?

There are many ways wireless technologies can be exploited, dependent on the target, technology and end goal. Some of these include:

- Bluejacking
- Bluesnarfing

### Bluejacking

Hacking is when someone gets illegal access to a computer system, and you've probably heard of it. But did you know that Bluetooth devices may be used in a similar way? Bluejacking is a sort of hacking that is relatively safe compared to other methods of hacking. Someone sends a Bluetooth message to an unwitting victim's phone in bluejacking. The message might be anything from a joke to a commercial. While bluejacking isn't a major threat, it is inconvenient. And if you get a lot of unsolicited Bluetooth messages, it might start to disrupt the usual working of your phone. Turning off your smartphone is the greatest thing you can do if you suspect you've been bluejacked.

### Bluesnarfing

Bluesnarfing is a sort of wireless hacking in which an attacker obtains access to a victim's Bluetooth-enabled device without their knowledge. After gaining access, the attacker can download sensitive data like as contacts, text messages, and calendar entries. What causes Bluesnarfing? The attacker starts by scanning the surroundings for Bluetooth-enabled gadgets. Once the attacker has located a device, he or she will attempt to pair it with the victim's device without the victim's awareness. If the attacker succeeds, he or she will have access to the victim's device and be able to begin downloading sensitive data.

## Final words

When it comes to the security of wireless technology, there is no single silver bullet. Organizations can take actions to reduce these risks by recognizing the hazards and vulnerabilities associated with these technologies. Organizations may secure their data and resources from unauthorised access by deploying robust authentication and encryption mechanisms. Furthermore, businesses should teach their personnel on how to utilize wireless devices properly as well as how to spot and report suspicious conduct. Organizations may lessen the danger of being hacked by attackers by implementing these safeguards.
