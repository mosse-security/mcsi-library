# Enumerating Active Directory with Powerview

In this blog post, we will practice enumerating the Active Directory using the Powershell PowerView module.

## Windows `Net` Command utilities

First, letâ€™s remember some examples of helpful commands:

- `net view /domain`: This command displays a list of all hosts in the specified domain.
- `net user /domain`: Displays a list of users.
- `net accounts /domain`: Displays the password policy.
- `net group /domain` : Displays a list of domain groups.
- `net group "Domain Admins" /domain` : Lists people in the group.
- `net share` : Displays the current number of SMB units.
- `net session`: This is used to examine SMB sessions.

Because net commands are incorporated into every Windows machine, understanding how to utilize them may be a valuable tool for testing Windows devices.

## Querying Active Directory groups using PowerView

PowerView is an extremely useful PowerShell tool for obtaining precise information on an organization's Active Directory domain and forest.

To utilize PowerView on our local machine, we first move the directory to where the PowerView module is located and disable PowerShell Execution Policy. The third command is then used to allow the use of PowerView with Powershell.

`cd Downloads`

` powershell -ExecutionPolicy bypass`

`. .\PowerView.ps1`

To retrieve information about your current domain run this command:

`Get-NetDomain`

In the following image, we get the forest and domain controller hostname.

We can also get the list of the domain policies of the defined domain with this command:

`Get-DomainPolicy`

This command shows all operating systems on the domain.

`Get-NetComputer -fulldata | select operatingsystem`

To easily retrieve the identity of the domain controller on the current domain, use the following command: `Get-NetDomainController`.

As shown in the following snippet, we got specific details about the domain controller such as its operating system, hostname, and IP addresses.
