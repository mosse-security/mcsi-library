# What are ICS and SCADA and Why Must they be Secured?
 
Industrial control systems (ICS) are assets and accompanying instruments that aid in the supervision of industrial operations. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, which assist organisations in controlling dispersed assets; distributed control systems (DCS), which control production systems in a local area; and programmable logic controllers (PLCs), which enable discrete control of applications using regulatory control, are three types of ICS.

SCADA systems, in summary, are industrial control systems that are used to remotely monitor and manage critical infrastructure. They are frequently used in utilities (such as water, gas, and electricity), transportation (such as air traffic control and rail), and industry. SCADA systems are mission-critical; a compromise might cause significant damage or even death. Recent high-profile SCADA system attacks, such as Stuxnet and Dragonfly, have shown that these systems are not as secure as they should be. Many experts feel that SCADA systems are chronically inadequately safeguarded. The issue is that SCADA systems were not created with security in mind; instead, they were meant to be dependable and efficient.

Distributed control systems (DCS) are networks of computing devices used to regulate physical processes. DCS systems are employed in many sectors, including oil and gas, chemical processing, and power production. A central control station is often utilised to run the system, and a variety of field devices are employed to communicate with the physical process. DCS systems are meant to be scalable, allowing them to handle both small and big, complicated operations. DCS systems are used to continuously monitor and control processes. They may be used to increase process efficiency and minimise process variability by automating process control.

PLCs are a form of ICS that is widely utilised in the industrial and other sectors. PLCs are programmable devices used to control equipment and other activities. PLCs are frequently used in combination with HMIs, which allow people to interact with the ICS. PLCs may be remotely managed, and this access can be utilised to manage and monitor the process that the PLC is regulating. However, attackers can utilise this remote access to acquire control of the PLC and the process it is managing.

ICS and SCADA systems are crucial to our nation's infrastructure. Unfortunately, these systems are subject to assault as well. According to a recent Department of Homeland Security assessment, ICS and SCADA systems contain substantial vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit. The research identifies the following vulnerabilities: - Inadequate security measures - Lack of knowledge and training - Poorly set up systems - Incompatible software and firmware These flaws can be used to obtain access to vital systems, disrupt operations, and inflict bodily harm. Adversaries may attack ICS and SCADA systems for a number of purposes, including intelligence gathering, interruption, or bodily harm.

Insecure remote access is a common form of attack. Insecure remote access implies that attackers from anywhere in the globe can acquire access to these systems simply by exploiting weaknesses. This sort of assault has the potential to be disastrous since it allows attackers to take control of essential infrastructure and industrial operations. It is critical to ensure that ICS and SCADA systems are appropriately protected to prevent these threats. This involves making certain that only authorised people have access to these systems and that all access is appropriately reported and monitored.

Despite the necessity of these systems, many businesses fail to give proper security training to their personnel. This is a critical issue since ICS systems are frequently complicated and difficult to safeguard. Employees who are not adequately trained may be unable to recognise and respond to ICS hazards. This can result in significant security breaches with disastrous repercussions. To preserve our vital infrastructure, organisations must give proper security training to their personnel.

The bottom line is that ICS and SCADA systems are complicated and sometimes antiquated, making them difficult to secure. Organizations must secure these systems in a thorough and risk-based manner, which includes patching vulnerabilities, adopting security controls, and monitoring for threats.
