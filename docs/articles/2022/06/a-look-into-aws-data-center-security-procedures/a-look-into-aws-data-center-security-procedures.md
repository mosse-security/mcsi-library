# A Look into AWS Data Center Security Procedures
 

As more and more businesses move to the cloud, it's important to understand the security procedures used by cloud providers. In this blog post, we'll take a look at the data center security procedures used by Amazon Web Services (AWS). We'll cover topics such as AWS's physical and environmental security protection measures. By the end of this post, you'll have a good understanding of the measures taken by AWS to keep your data safe and secure.

## Introduction

AWS server farms employs cutting-edge structural and technical solutions. Amazon has extensive expertise in planning, building, and maintaining extensive data centers. That knowledge has been transferred to the AWS cloud and infrastructure.

## Physical security

Let's look at AWS's physical protection measures.

- AWS facilities are located in ordinary buildings. Professional security personnel use surveillance footage, IDSs, and other electronic techniques to rigorously regulate physical access at the perimeter as well as at facility entrance points.
- To get access to the building, authorized personnel must first complete two-factor authentication.
- Every guest and supplier must show identity, and be checked in. They are also constantly accompanied by authorized personnel.

- AWS only grants data center accessibility to staff members and vendors with a solid enterprise need for such access and knowledge. If a worker's access to these permissions is no longer required for business purposes, it is instantly withdrawn, even if the employee remains an Amazon or AWS employee.
- Every physical access to facilities by AWS personnel is frequently monitored and audited.

## Environmental security

AWS is also responsible for controlling environmental security. Here are some measures employed in facilities.

### Fire Detection and Extinguishment

To mitigate risk, AWS data centers include automated fire diagnosis and suppression technology. In all data center settings, electrical and mechanical architecture areas, cooling areas, power systems and equipment rooms, smoke detection sensors are used.

### Power Redundancy

The electrical energy supplied in AWS facilities are built to be completely redundant and maintained 7/24 without affecting business. Reliable Power Supply devices offer backup power for vital and necessary workloads in the case of an electrical breakdown. Generators are used in AWS data centers to supply backup power for the whole building.

### Temperature and Climate Management

Weather management is essential to keep servers and other gear at a consistent working temperature, avoiding overheating and decreasing the likelihood of outages. Amazon web services data centers are designed to preserve ideal atmospheric events. Employees and technologies track and manage temperature and relative humidity levels as needed.

### Equipment Management

AWS examines electrical and mechanical systems and gears to detect problems as soon as they occur. AWS personnel performs proactive upkeep to ensure that equipment remains operational.

### Storage Device Management

If a storage item reaches the end of its life, AWS policies provide a dismantling process to protect client data from unauthorized persons.

## Summary

In this blog post, we have learned how AWS is in charge of the physical and environmental security of its facilities.
