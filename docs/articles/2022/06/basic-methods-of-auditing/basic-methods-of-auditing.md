# Basic Methods of Auditing
 
As a security professional, you understand the need for audits to safeguard the company's information security. Analysing the security logs is equally essential. Security logs may provide a plethora of information on who is logging into the systems when they are logging in, and what they are doing. This data may be quite useful in detecting patterns and identifying possible security issues. Regularly auditing your security logs might assist you in keeping your systems safe and secure.

## Security logs

Security logs are simply a record of all computer or network activities. This activity can range from simple user logins and file access to more in-depth system activities. Security logs may be extremely important in discovering the cause of a security issue or detecting whether a system has been hacked. Operating systems, applications, and security devices such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems can all create security logs. Security logs are often created automatically and kept locally on the system or device that generated them. Some firms keep their security records in one place for easy monitoring and analysis. Security logs can include a variety of information that can be utilized to establish what occurred during a security breach.

## Access Control List (ACL)

An Access Control List (ACL) is a set of permissions associated with a particular item. ACLs may be used in audits to assist guarantee that only authorized users have access to specified resources. There are a few things to bear in mind when auditing ACLs. First, ensure that the ACLs are appropriate for the resources being protected. Second, confirm that the ACLs are correctly established and that no illegal entries exist. Finally, make certain that the ACLs are appropriately enforced. You should take remedial action if you discover that the ACLs are not suitable for the resources they are protecting.

## User rights and permissions

Any auditing program relies heavily on user rights and permissions. Auditors can more properly analyze the risks associated with such activities if they understand what users can accomplish on a system. User rights are classified into two types: system-level rights and application-level rights. Users with system-level permissions can access system resources like as files, directories, and printers. Application-level privileges, on the other hand, allow users to access particular apps like databases or word processors. Both forms of rights can be further subdivided into explicit and implicit rights. Explicit rights are those that are provided to a user explicitly, such as the permission to view a file.

## Vulnerabilities scans

Vulnerability scans are an essential component of any auditing procedure. They aid in the identification of possible security vulnerabilities and can give useful information for future investigation. There are many various sorts of vulnerability scans, but they all have the same goal: to identify vulnerabilities in systems that attackers may exploit. The network vulnerability scan is one of the most common forms of vulnerability scans. This sort of scan checks for vulnerabilities in network-connected systems. Web application vulnerability scans are another prominent sort of vulnerability scan. This sort of scan searches for flaws in web applications. Manual or automated vulnerability scans are available. Security scanning tools frequently do automatic scans.

## Written organizational policies

Written rules should be in place for organizations to ensure that their personnel understand what is expected of them. It will be easier to detect and rectify any problems that may occur if these regulations are in place. Maintaining a high degree of integrity is one of the most crucial characteristics of a great organization. Maintaining integrity includes ensuring that all personnel adhere to the same standards of behaviour. Having written policies in place is one approach to assist guarantee that all employees are held to the same standards.

It is clear from the preceding explanation that there are several advantages to performing an audit of the information security system. However, it is equally crucial to highlight that the auditing process is not without its difficulties. One of the most significant issues is the industry's lack of standards. This implies that various organizations perform their audits in different ways. As a result, comparing the outcomes of several audits might be challenging. Nonetheless, the advantages of auditing information security systems far exceed the difficulties. As a result, it is recommended that all firms perform frequent audits of their information security systems.
