# Introduction to Patching
 

Patching is a process of applying updates to software or computer systems. These updates can be small, such as fixing a bug, or they can be large, such as adding new features or security enhancements. In either case, patching is an important part of keeping systems up-to-date and secure. The patch management life cycle is the process of planning, testing and deploying patches in a controlled and consistent manner. By keeping systems up-to-date, patching and effective patch management can help reduce the risk of attacks and make systems more resistant to exploitation. In this blog post, we age going to learn what is patching, and what are some key aspects to consider in a patch management plan.

## What is patching?

Patch management, which is also often known as patching, is frequently seen as a subtype of configuration management. Software patches are vendor-released upgrades. These patches either repair functionality flaws or address security gaps in computer systems, programs, and firmware versions that operate on network devices.

## The patch management life cycle

You should establish a formal system to guarantee that all systems receive the recent updates following extensive testing in a non-production environment to confirm that all endpoints have the current fixes loaded.

It is hard for a vendor to foresee every conceivable impact a modification may have on a network's systems. It is the organization’s commitment to guarantee that fixes do not disrupt production environment.

The following sections cover the key aspects that a company must incorporate into its patch management plan.

- Evaluate the priority of the fixes and plan their implementation.
- Before implementation, verify the patches to make sure everything is running correctly and do not create system or security risks.
- In the production environment, apply the fixes.
- Check that the fixes are working correctly after they have been installed.

Many businesses use a centralized patch management system to guarantee that patches are distributed on time. Managers or system admins can use this system to test and evaluate all fixes before releasing them to the systems they impact. Admins can arrange upgrades to take place during off-peak hours.

## Importance of patching

In many circumstances, inadequate security patches enable a risk of an attack. A number of assets must be updated or checked for upgrades. This encompasses any operating system patches, updates for any functioning apps, and updates for any anti-malware software that is installed. Search for any firmware updates that the machine may need while you're at it. You should also check for software and firmware upgrades if any routing devices or switches have been exploited.

## Conclusion

You don't want to risk network breakdowns owing to emerging new compatibility issues, but you also don't want existing technology to be targeted due to your patching restrictions. As we have covered in this blog post, patch management is a critical step in securing a company’s assets.
