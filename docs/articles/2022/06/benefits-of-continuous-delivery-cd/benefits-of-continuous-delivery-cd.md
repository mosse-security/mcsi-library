# Benefits of Continuous Delivery CD
 

In this blog post, we are going to explain continuous delivery (CD), and how we can utilize it in DevSecOps. Lastly, we will make a brief comparison between continuous integration and continuous delivery. Letâ€™s start by defining what is CD...

## What are the benefits of Continuous Delivery (CD)?

The process of keeping the shared code in a deliverable condition is known as continuous delivery. The key benefit of this process is that the software may be produced under testing requirements at periodic intervals throughout each its design phase, enabling deliveries to be made even though the team is still working on the ultimate product's lifecycle.

During the Continuous Delivery process, the integrated code (IC) is constantly checked across several settings until it reaches the early production phase. Furthermore, the workflow gives constant feedback, allowing us to enhance the product instantly following each change to the source code.

### CD and pre-delivery

Previously, the end design was only released if all capabilities were fully built, operated flawlessly, and no serious problems were identified when quality testing was completed. As a result, the programmer had to publish fixes or updates on a regular basis. However, with CD, the client gets the project in an early stage in the lifecycle, where it has not yet been finalized.

This pre-delivery often contains the basic functionality of the program, allowing clients to evaluate it in a real-world setting. As a result, the customer (or software tester) plays a significant part in the quality control process.

### CD and continuous feedback

In CD, the developer can enhance the functionality of the product throughout the development process due to the feedback obtained. If a change has unexpected consequences, we can notice them promptly and plan a strategy early in the design process. This is a big plus since it makes it easier to spot problems in the code.

Furthermore, the developer team gains vital data to help them decide what features to create next. As a result, the three domains of research, quality control, and manufacturing are never replaced by a single process but are always interrelated.

### CD and automation

Working with several clients makes things like this unfeasible unless we have automated processes in place. This is where continuous delivery comes into play since it is in charge of automating the whole building workflow.

## Differences between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration (CD)

Continuous integration refers to the automation of the testing process, thus the pipeline is an element that is linked with continuous delivery.

Continuous delivery is a wider concept that includes the automated software delivery process. Continuous delivery supports the continuous integration methodology by including the end-user as they provide the product while also running the required tests.

## Summary

In this blog post, we defined what is continuous delivery and its powerful characteristics which enhance the overall success of our software development projects. Now you know how you can achieve agility without trading off security by employing CI/CD in your software building environment.
