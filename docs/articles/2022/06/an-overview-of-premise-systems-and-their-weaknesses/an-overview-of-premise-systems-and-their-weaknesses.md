# An Overview of Premise Systems and their Weaknesses
 
A premise system is a sort of security system that is installed in a building or other type of location. The system is intended to keep unauthorised people out of the premises and to keep the inhabitants safe. The technology may also be used to monitor resident activity and detect intruders. Office buildings, factories, warehouses, and retail outlets are all places where premises systems are employed. They're also common in residential settings like flats and houses. The amount of security offered by a premise system is determined by the type of system deployed. Door and window sensors, as well as motion detectors, are common components of basic systems. Cameras, alarm systems, and access control are examples of more advanced systems.

## What is a BAS?

A BAS, or Building Automation System, is a computerised system that manages and monitors mechanical and electrical equipment. A BAS can be used as a standalone system or as part of a larger facility management system. A building automation system (BAS) is intended to increase the efficiency of a building's operations while also providing a comfortable and safe environment. BAS are frequently connected to the internet, making them vulnerable to cyber threats. A BAS may be used to obtain illegal access to the HVAC, lighting, and security systems of a building. An assailant may be able to deactivate alarms, unlock doors, and switch off lights, posing a safety risk to inhabitants. There have been a number of high-profile attacks on BAS in recent years, notably the Stuxnet virus, which attacked Iranian nuclear facilities. BAS may be made more secure by segmenting the network, employing firewalls, and keeping systems up to speed with the most recent security updates. However, even with these security mechanisms in place, BAS may be attacked.

## What is a PACS?

A physical access control system (PACS) regulates physical access to a building or place. Identification devices, such as cards, keypads, or biometric readers; control devices, such as doors, gates, or turnstiles; and a management system, which regulates and monitors the system, are common components of a PACS. PACS systems are used to safeguard a wide range of assets, including buildings, equipment, and people. They are utilised in a number of situations, including offices, government buildings, schools, and hospitals. Physical attacks, social engineering, and technological exploitation are all possible dangers to PACS.

Most PACs are not set to be secure by default. They usually use weak passwords, are seldom updated, and have few or no security safeguards in place. As a result, they are a prime target for attackers looking to obtain access to sensitive data or disrupt operations. While there are several methods that can be done to increase PACS security, it is critical to understand the dangers in order to make informed judgments about how to safeguard your network.

## What are the vulnerabilities of a Premise System?

A premise system has several weaknesses. The most apparent example is that if an intruder obtains physical access to a building, they can interfere with the system in a variety of ways. They may, for example, disconnect or destroy equipment, or they could change the system's code to suit their needs. Another risk is that if an attacker gains access to the premises network, they may be able to remotely manage the system. This might allow them to deactivate alarms or open doors and gates without triggering alarms. Another weakness of the premise system is its reliance on electronic keypads and card readers for security.

Finally, system administrators must take proactive measures to safeguard their on-premises systems. They may more successfully safeguard their networks and prevent unwanted access if they understand the risks and vulnerabilities connected with premises systems.
