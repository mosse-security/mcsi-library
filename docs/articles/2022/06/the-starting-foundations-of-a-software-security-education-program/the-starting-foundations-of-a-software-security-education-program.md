# The Starting Foundations of a Software Security Education Program
 

In this blog post, we will cover the necessity of developing an appsec awareness and education program and how it may assist to equip the staff to integrate security into all development activities.

## What is an appsec education program and why do we need them?

Software security education program is a subset of information security awareness or learning programs. A good software security education program is critical to reaching the appropriate employees in their varied tasks across the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It is also necessary for providing the necessary quantity of information for each stakeholder group.

## Fundamentals of Software Security Education

While building an appsec training and awareness program, the following broad recommendations should be followed:

- First and foremost, you must obtain management permission and assistance for a secure application development education program. You'll need to get this assistance to launch a strategy, get sufficient funding and personnel, and maintain the program running in the face of failure or interruptions.

- Establish explicit organizational goals, rules, and software security requirements. Developing and then implementing established corporate goals, rules, and procedures for secure application development as the foundation for your awareness and training program establishes a close correlation to developer behaviors that lead to adherence and "defense in depth" come to life.

- Adapt educational resources to meet the demands of certain roles in the development team. You should also create dynamic study materials that are customized to the particular roles within your SDLC since every role has different needs.

- Learning and practice are closely linked. Adjust the curriculum so that the team members can enhance their knowledge by practicing. The more individuals acquire new abilities, the faster the information becomes a habit.

- Your apps are the best source of security issues. When users identify problems with source code and systems they already know, the effects of abusing the code's weaknesses become more apparent. So, use your own experience.

- You must also adjust the training material length appropriately. Education must take place as near to the level of need as feasible. A long training that addresses a whole list of issues may be useless if finding an answer to a specific issue among the bulk of the material is cumbersome. Let your staff access solutions fast and easily.

- Incorporate learning objectives into your technical education plan. Acknowledge your staff as they successfully move through the programs and ensure everyone is aware of it.

## Conclusion

Upon completion of this blog, now youâ€™ve learned how to establish an effective education program to help developers obtain the knowledge and abilities they need to excel as security-focused development teams.
