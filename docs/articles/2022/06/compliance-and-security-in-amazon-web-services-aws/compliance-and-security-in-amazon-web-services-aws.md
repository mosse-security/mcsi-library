# Compliance and Security in Amazon Web Services (AWS)
 

Information security is crucial for enterprises operating critical workloads, whether on-premises or in any cloud provider's data centers. Security is a fundamental need that protects vital data from unintentional or intentional stealing, disclosure, breach, and removal. Here is a basic overview of AWS's security and compliance strategy.

## Security

- Every AWS client utilizes facilities and technology deployment designed to meet the needs of the enterprise's security concerns. AWS and its vendors provide numerous services and capabilities to assist companies in meeting their security requirements. This implies that enterprises may get the protection they want without the financial investment and with far reduced operating expenses than in an on-premises setting.

- Companies that use AWS acquire all the quality standards of AWS policy, infrastructure, and operating processes designed to meet the security needs of the clients.

- The AWS architecture is intended to deliver maximum availability and implement strict client privacy and segmentation measures.

- As applications are deployed on the Amazon web services, AWS assists by dividing duties related to security with the company. The underlying architecture is governed by AWS, and the company may protect everything it installs on AWS. This provides each company with the security controls, speed, and adaptability they want.

- The infrastructure is developed and maintained not merely in accordance with privacy standards and best practices but also with the cloud's specific requirements in mind.

- AWS employs additional and multilayered governance, constant verification, and extensive automation to guarantee that the supporting infrastructure is managed and secured continuously. AWS guarantees that these policies are enforced uniformly in each new facility or product.

## Compliance

When clients migrate their operational workloads to the Amazon Web services, both sides take on responsibility for the IT infrastructure. Clients are committed to ensuring that their workplace is safe and managed. Clients must also ensure proper governance of their overall IT control environment. AWS helps customers to expand on conventional compliance programs by connecting governance-centered, easy-to-monitor service capabilities with appropriate compliance or audit requirements. This assists enterprises in setting up and operating in an AWS security control environment.

Companies have total control and ownership (which is abbreviated as TCO) over the physical location of their data, enabling them to fulfill regional compliance and federal data requirements.

AWS's IT infrastructure is developed and maintained in accordance with security standards and a range of IT security requirements. Here below is a shortlist of the several licenses and regulations that AWS adheres to:

- Service Organization Controls (SOC) 1
- International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3402, SOC 2, and SOC 3
- Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)
- The Department of Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP)
- Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Level 1
- International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001, ISO 27001, and ISO 27018

AWS delivers a great deal of information about its IT management system to assist enterprises in meeting regulatory obligations through audits, licenses, qualifications, and other third-party confirmation.
