# Networking Tools Protocol Analysers
 
Protocol analysers are essential tools for embedded system designers. They let engineers obtain insight into the data that goes through the communication channel or bus, such as USB, I2C, SPI, CAN, and so on. Some systems record this information and then show it after capture, whilst others display the data as it is transmitted in real-time. As a result, it's simple to see why protocol analysers are so vital in embedded design, development, and debugging processes.

## Uses of protocol analysers

Protocol analysers in embedded systems capture data as it travels through a communication bus. Engineers and developers can use protocol analysers to create, debug, and test their designs across the whole development life-cycle of a hardware device.

A protocol analyser is designed to work with a particular serial or parallel bus architecture. These devices are frequently referred to as bus analysers or network analysers. They may also be utilized for network traffic analysis on LAN, PAN, and even wireless networks.
Protocol analysers allow you to continually monitor and interpret bus data. The collected data may then be analysed to provide actionable reports and present helpful information to the embedded developer.

Protocol analysers are pieces of hardware that may be linked to an embedded device. However, in order to comprehend the data recorded by the hardware, a user interface that presents the bus data in a human-readable format is required. In other words, a protocol analyser is a mix of dedicated hardware and software that function in unison. The hardware and software work together to acquire data, and the program displays the captured data.

However, not all interfaces are created equal. Some merely show the data collection, whilst others let you search, build filters, find patterns, and decode in real-time.
Let's have a look at some of the most popular network protocols in use today.

## Types of Network Protocols

* USB Protocol
The USB protocol is by far the most used communication protocol in today's consumer market. Anyone who has a computer, mobile phone, or tablet has, intentionally or unwittingly, utilized the USB protocol in the form of Flash drives, data cards, USB cables, chargers, and so on.
USB is an abbreviation for Universal Serial Bus. The USB protocol, as the name implies, is used to send data serially, one bit at a time. USB is essentially a polled bus, with the host initiating all data transactions.

* CAN Protocol
In an embedded context, the CAN (Controller Area Network) Protocol is used to simplify communication between microcontrollers and connected devices. It is especially useful when there is no host computer present.

* I2C Protocol
The I2C protocol has been around for more than four decades and is still quite popular today. IIC, which stands for Inter-Integrated Circuit, is another name for I2C. I2C can be used to provide short-distance communication between two ICs on the same circuit board.
The I2C protocol's main differentiator is its straightforward architecture, customizable features, improved chip addressing, and solid error handling mechanism. However, I2C has downsides such as sluggish transfer speeds and the amount of space it takes up on the circuit board.

* SPI protocol
SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface), like I2C, is utilized in embedded devices for short-distance communication. It is a serial communication protocol that uses a master-slave architecture to function in full-duplex mode. SPI protocol allows you to link many slave devices. Keep in mind, however, that SPI only allows a single master device.

* eSPI Protocol
Intel created the eSPI (Enhanced Serial Peripheral Interface) bus, which is effectively an SPI bus with fewer pins. The eSPI bus's operating voltage has also been reduced to 1.8V to enable newer manufacturing methods.

Finally, a protocol analyzer is an extremely useful tool for debugging, troubleshooting, and diagnosing networking problems. A protocol analyzer can offer extensive information about what is happening on the network by capturing and decoding traffic. A protocol analyzer, when used correctly, may be a helpful tool for network administrators and engineers.
