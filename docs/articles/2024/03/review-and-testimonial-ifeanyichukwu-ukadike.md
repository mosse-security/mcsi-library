# Review and Testimonial: Ifeanyichukwu Ukadike

Ifeanyichukwu's professional journey began in IT support, but his passion for cybersecurity led him to make a career transition. Committed to continuous learning, he invests significant time in mastering relevant frameworks and tools in the field. Additionally, he possesses programming skills, primarily utilizing Python and its frameworks for software development.

As a relatively new cybersecurity professional, Ifeanyichukwu has demonstrated his dedication to professional growth by obtaining certifications such as eJPT, ICCA, and CC.

To complement the theoretical knowledge gained through academics, Ifeanyichukwu has enrolled in MRCI, which offers practical knowledge and hands-on experience. He also plans to explore additional MCSI certifications in the future.

**You have been a student on the MCSI Online Learning Platform for a while now. Can you please tell us about how you embarked on your learning journey?**

While researching for my first certification In the early stages of my cybersecurity journey, I stumbled upon the MCSI Online Learning Platform. Although I opted for a different certification, as I delved deeper into cybersecurity, I discovered a significant gap between the theoretical knowledge I had and the hands-on application. To bridge this gap, I explored DIY labs, which proved to be a rewarding experience. Recalling my previous encounter with an online learning platform emphasizing the DIY approach, I started my learning journey on the MCSI Online Learning Platform.

**Did you enroll in any of the MCSI Certifications?**

Yes, I did. I enrolled for the Mossé Remote Cybersecurity Internship (MRCI).

**That's great to know! Did another MCSI Certification interest you?**

Absolutely. After completing the Mossé Remote Cybersecurity Internship (MRCI) certification, I plan to enroll in the Mossé Threat Hunting (MTH) certification.

**What was your first impression of the platform?**

What impressed me the most was the requirement for an instructor to review my solution, ensuring that I successfully met the exercise objectives. Additionally, the platform provides a valuable knowledge library, which I can utilize to gain a theoretical understanding of unfamiliar topics before attempting practical exercises. Based on my initial experience, I was left with the overall impression that the platform is comprehensively designed and offers a complete learning solution.

**Were you able to navigate through the platform with ease?**

Though it might take some adjustment initially, the overall navigation is user-friendly.

**How would you describe your learning experience so far?**

The journey has been rewarding, though not without its challenges. Each task presents an opportunity to learn new things and solve problems. As I tackle these challenges, I find the feeling of imposter syndrome gradually diminishing.

**Did you require any special equipment to work on the exercises?**

Not at all. All I needed was a laptop that could run at least two virtual machines simultaneously using Oracle Virtual Box software and OBS Studio for screen recording purposes.

**Did you encounter any challenges while working on the exercises? If yes, how did you navigate through them?**

While solving some exercises, I faced challenges due to changes or discontinuation of the recommended tool since the exercise's release. This makes solving the affected exercises an issue. However, I always resorted to solving the exercise as best as I could using the recommended tools. I also went a step further and used the updated tool to attempt to solve the affected exercises.

**How was your experience submitting the solutions for every exercise?**

Generally, the process was straightforward. However, the three-minute video requirement presented a significant challenge. I had to carefully decide what critical information to include and exclude in my submission. If the video exceeded the three-minute limit, I had to redo the exercise or do additional editing to ensure I did not exceed the time limit.

**For exercises that involved a video submission, did you have to learn video editing skills?**

Not really as the video editing I did was limited to basic tasks such as trimming, cutting, and joining video segments. To reduce the amount of editing required, I paused my screen recording during non-critical aspects of the lab exercise.

**Were you comfortable with how the exercises were graded upon submission?**

Yes. However, the criteria for awarding gold and silver medals are not entirely clear. There seems to be no benchmark, and the decision seems to be based on the instructor's discretion.

**How do you expect your career to advance with the skills you have gained from the Online Learning Platform?**

With my progress in the MRCI course and the noticeable improvement it has brought, I am even more confident in my growth as a cybersecurity professional. Additionally, to further enhance my abilities and expertise, I plan to pursue the Mossé Threat Hunting (MTH) certification. I am confident that the MTH course will provide me with essential skills and techniques to excel in the role of a threat hunter.

**Who do you think is the appropriate audience for this platform?**

If you are a beginner or a professional with a few years of experience and you want a head-first approach, this platform is for you. Keep in mind that learning can feel overwhelming at times, and that's natural, so it's ok to take a break and come back when you're okay.

**On an ending note, what would you like to tell our readers about the MCSI Online Learning Platform?**

While many platforms present a pre-configured lab environment, the MCSI Online Learning Platform encourages you to set up your own. Initially, it might appear more convenient to have everything ready, but spending time creating your labs offers valuable benefits. With practice, setting up labs becomes effortless and routine.

Initially, when first starting on the platform, I often became frustrated. The reason for my frustration was having to build the VMs, network them, and make them vulnerable for exploitation or patching. This process required extensive reading before the VMs would function properly. Nevertheless, the experience has been incredibly valuable, significantly reducing my initial anxiety. With the right understanding and patience, I can confidently build any lab.

I'm looking forward to exploring all that the MCSI Online Learning Platform has to offer.
