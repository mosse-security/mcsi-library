# Isolation, Containment, and Segmentation After an Incident

In today\'s hyperconnected digital landscape, cybersecurity breaches
have become increasingly common, making it essential for organizations
to be prepared not only to prevent incidents but also to effectively
respond when they occur. While cybersecurity efforts typically
prioritize prevention and detection, the aftermath of an incident
demands equal attention. The ability to isolate compromised systems,
contain the damage, and implement segmentation to prevent lateral
movement of threats can be the difference between swift recovery and
prolonged disruption. In this article, we will delve deeply into the
critical components of post-incident cybersecurity strategies, with a
special focus on three essential techniques: isolation, containment, and
segmentation. These strategies are the linchpins in the cybersecurity
arsenal, pivotal in securing the environment and minimizing the damage
wrought by a breach.

## Understanding the Post-Incident Landscape

When faced with a cybersecurity incident, whether it takes the form of a
data breach, a malware infection, or a deliberate targeted attack, the
initial response must extend beyond merely identifying the threat and
eradicating it. Often, the full extent of the damage remains uncertain,
and the threat actors may maintain a presence within the network. It is
in these uncertain and critical moments that mitigation techniques come
to the forefront of cybersecurity strategy. These techniques are not
just about immediate containment; they encompass a comprehensive set of
actions designed to minimize the impact, limit the threat\'s reach, and
facilitate a thorough investigation. Mitigation techniques are the
linchpin of an effective response to a cyber incident, ensuring that
organizations can navigate the intricate landscape of post-incident
cybersecurity with resilience and strategic precision.

## Securing the Environment through Isolation, Containment, and Segmentation

In the aftermath of a cybersecurity incident, when the digital defenses
have been breached, and the threat landscape is uncertain, the
importance of a well-structured and strategic response cannot be
overstated. Beyond the initial detection and eradication of the threat,
the concepts of isolation, containment, and segmentation emerge as
critical pillars of post-incident cybersecurity. These concepts are not
just reactive measures; they form a proactive strategy to secure the
environment, minimize damage, and restore operational integrity. In this
examination, we will explore the intricate domain of isolation,
containment, and segmentation post-incident, revealing how these
fundamental techniques serve as the bedrock of resilience against cyber
threats.

### Isolation: Cutting Off the Threat

Isolation is the first and most critical step in mitigating a
cybersecurity incident.

*Immediate Action:* As soon as a breach is detected, it\'s imperative to
isolate the affected systems. This can be achieved by shutting down
ports, disabling network connections, or utilizing automated tools to
quarantine compromised devices.

*Predefined Procedures*: Establish predefined plans and procedures
(runbooks and playbooks) to guide the isolation process during
incidents. These documents outline the steps to take when an incident
occurs, ensuring a rapid and effective response.

*Prioritizing Critical Assets:* Not all systems are equal. Critical
assets and high-value data should be isolated first to minimize the
impact of the breach.

Two primary methods often used for isolation are air gaps and
virtualization. The choice between air gaps and virtualization depends
on the specific security requirements and practical considerations of
each organization. Air gaps involve creating a figurative or literal
\"air gap\" to separate the compromised systems or network segments from
the rest of the environment. Virtualization involves creating virtual
instances or environments that operate independently within a single
physical system or server. It allows for the isolation of different
systems, applications, or network segments on the same hardware. The
goal is to prevent the threat from spreading further.

#### Air Gaps

-   **Definition:** An air gap is a physical or logical separation
    between a network or system and external networks or other networks
    within the same organization. It involves disconnecting a system or
    network completely from external connections, including the
    internet, to ensure there is no connectivity whatsoever. This
    isolation is particularly vital in environments where utmost
    security is required, with zero tolerance for malware or virus
    infiltration.

-   **Application:** When an incident occurs, organizations may resort
    to air gapping critical systems or networks to prevent the threat
    from propagating further. This approach is particularly common in
    highly secure environments where any potential compromise poses an
    immense risk. While commonly associated with internet isolation, air
    gaps can also apply to isolating networks within an organization.

> Air-gapped networks, notably used in critical infrastructure such as
> Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, are ideal
> for safeguarding highly sensitive information. Stuxnet highlighted
> vulnerabilities, driving the adoption of advanced security measures.

-   **Benefits:** Air gaps provide an extremely high level of security,
    as they sever all external communication channels. They are
    especially effective for safeguarding critical infrastructure and
    sensitive data. Air gaps are ideal for protecting highly sensitive
    information, including classified data, trade secrets, and
    government secrets.

> They prevent lateral movement of threats within an organization\'s
> infrastructure and offer a security advantage as they do not rely on
> continuous online security measures like firewalls or intrusion
> detection systems. Air gaps can protect systems from zero-day threats
> for which no immediate defense or patch is available and allow
> organizations to transfer data between isolated systems manually,
> using secure methods like physically transferring storage devices.

-   **Limitations:** While highly secure, air-gapped systems can be
    challenging to manage and may not be practical for all scenarios.
    There is no guarantee of complete protection, as advanced threats
    have occasionally found ways to breach even air-gapped networks.
    Instances of malware jumping into air-gapped environments, like
    Stuxnet, have underscored their vulnerabilities. Air-gapped networks
    provide the highest level of security but come at the cost of
    limited connectivity.

> Recognizing these limitations, agencies worldwide have established
> specific guidelines for additional security measures, such as TEMPEST.
> This involves constructing secure rooms with specified wall thickness,
> coatings, Faraday cages, and other protections to prevent emanations
> and monitoring from nearby locations.

-   **Advanced Breaching Techniques:** Although they are highly
    effective, it\'s important to recognize that air gaps are not
    foolproof, and advanced techniques have been demonstrated to breach
    them. For example, emanation monitoring can capture signals emitted
    by devices, such as sounds generated by hard drives or the heat
    produced during their operation. These techniques, while not within
    the reach of the average hacker, highlight the need for constant
    vigilance and the implementation of additional security measures
    beyond air gaps.

-   **Security Enhancements:** Security measures like TEMPEST involve
    physical safeguards to protect against emanation monitoring. This
    includes mitigating electromagnetic signals, FM frequencies, and
    even monitoring small LED lights on hard drives to prevent data
    leakage. These enhancements ensure that even the subtlest signals or
    emanations are shielded, making it exceedingly difficult for
    attackers to breach air-gapped environments.

Air gaps are a powerful security measure for isolating networks from
external threats. However, recognizing their vulnerabilities and the
potential for advanced breach techniques, organizations implement
additional security measures to safeguard critical information and
infrastructure effectively. These comprehensive security practices
ensure a high degree of protection in even the most sensitive and secure
environments.

#### Virtualization

-   **Definition:** Virtualization involves creating virtual instances
    or environments that operate independently within a single physical
    system or server. It enables the creation of independent,
    self-contained virtual instances (sandboxed environments) that run
    within a controlled and isolated or segmented environment. It allows
    for the isolation of different systems, applications, or network
    segments on the same hardware, including routers, switches, load
    balancers, and firewalls. This isolation means that these
    applications are kept separate from the underlying host system.

-   **Application:** In the event of a cybersecurity incident,
    virtualization technology can be leveraged to isolate compromised
    systems or segments. Virtual machines (VMs) can be separated from
    the rest of the network, preventing the threat from spreading beyond
    the virtualized environment. Virtualization provides isolation for
    different services, reducing the impact of failures or security
    breaches on other VMs.

> Virtualization separates the guest systems (virtual machines) from the
> host system (physical machine). Regardless of the virtualization
> technology used (e.g., Hyper-V, VMware, KVM, VirtualBox), this
> separation ensures that the virtual guests operate independently of
> the host.

-   **Benefits:** Virtualization offers flexibility, scalability and
    optimizes resource utilization.. It enables quick and dynamic
    isolation, making it an effective tool for containment.
    Additionally, virtual snapshots can be utilized to revert
    compromised systems to previous states. This isolation provides a
    secure testing ground. Changes, including software updates, can be
    tested without affecting the rest of the network or the host system.

> Virtualization also permits the creation of snapshots, enabling an
> organization to quickly revert to previous states if needed. It
> enhances security by preventing guests from interfering with or
> compromising the host system. Virtualized network infrastructure can
> be quickly instantiated on demand, adapting to changing workloads.
> This eliminates the need for the time-consuming processes associated
> with physical infrastructure, such as purchasing, installation, and
> configuration.

-   **Limitations:** Virtualization is dependent on the underlying
    hypervisor\'s security. If the hypervisor is compromised, it can
    potentially affect all VMs. Organizations must ensure the security
    of their virtualization infrastructure.

Virtualization is a versatile technology that offers benefits like
isolation, security, efficient resource utilization, and rapid
deployment of virtual instances, not only for servers but also for
various network infrastructure components. It provides a flexible and
agile approach to managing and optimizing computing resources within an
organization.

### Containment: Limiting the Damage

Once the threat has been isolated, the next step is containment.
Containment is a vital mitigation technique employed in response to a
cybersecurity incident. Its primary objective is to limit the damage
caused by the incident and to prevent the threat from spreading further
within the network or system. Here\'s a breakdown of how containment
works and its key components:

-   **Limiting the Threat\'s Impact:** The core purpose of containment
    is to restrict the scope of the incident. When an incident occurs,
    whether it\'s a malware infection, a breach, or any other cyber
    threat, containment measures aim to confine the threat\'s effects to
    a specific area or system, preventing it from proliferating
    throughout the entire network.

-   **Reverting to Safe States:** In cases where virtualization
    technology is in use, containment often involves reverting
    compromised systems or components to a known safe state or snapshot.
    This action effectively erases any unauthorized changes made by the
    attackers, restoring the system to a secure configuration.

-   **Cloning for Investigation:** Containment may also involve cloning
    affected systems or resources for offline forensic analysis. Cloning
    allows cybersecurity experts to examine the incident in a controlled
    environment, gather evidence, and gain a comprehensive understanding
    of how the threat entered the network and its potential impact.

-   **Resource Scaling:** In certain scenarios, containment can include
    leveraging virtualization to rapidly scale up additional resources
    or systems to maintain business continuity while addressing the
    incident. This ensures that critical operations can continue running
    smoothly despite the security incident.

-   **Resource Isolation:** Containment can also involve isolating the
    compromised resource, device, or system from the rest of the
    network. This isolation limits the threat\'s ability to communicate
    with other network elements, reducing the potential for further
    harm.

-   **Enhanced Access Controls:** During containment, access controls
    and permissions may be intensified. This might entail tightening
    security measures, such as modifying firewall rules or restricting
    user access, to prevent unauthorized interactions with the affected
    systems.

-   **Data Backup and Recovery:** Part of containment may include
    ensuring the backup and recovery of critical data and systems. This
    safeguards essential information and ensures it can be restored if
    the incident has resulted in data loss or corruption.

-   **Forensic Analysis:** Containment also provides an opportunity for
    comprehensive forensic analysis, helping organizations determine the
    extent of the breach, identify vulnerabilities, and gather evidence
    for potential legal or law enforcement action.

Containment is a critical component of an organization\'s incident
response plan. It is focused on immediate actions to control and
mitigate the incident\'s impact, prevent its escalation, and facilitate
the subsequent investigation and recovery efforts. The goal is to limit
damage, reduce downtime, and minimize potential financial and
reputational losses caused by the incident.

### Segmentation: Preventing Lateral Movement

Segmentation often runs in parallel with containment efforts. While
containment addresses the immediate threat and prevents its further
spread, segmentation focuses on creating clear security boundaries
within the network to enhance overall security. Segmentation involves
dividing the network into separate logical subnets or VLANs, reducing
the risk of malware or ransomware spreading across the entire network.
Here\'s how segmentation works during this phase:

-   **Enhanced Access Controls:** As containment is established, access
    controls and firewall rules within the segmented areas are further
    tightened. This step ensures that even if the threat tries to move
    within the segmented network, it encounters additional security
    measures that restrict its activities.

-   **Monitoring and Detection:** Segmented areas are subject to
    enhanced monitoring and detection efforts. Security teams closely
    monitor network traffic and system behavior within each segment to
    detect any signs of residual threats or suspicious activities.

-   **Data Isolation and Protection:** Sensitive data, if compromised,
    continues to be isolated within separate segments. Data protection
    measures, such as encryption and access controls, are reinforced to
    prevent data leakage and maintain data integrity.

-   **Segmentation Techniques:** Utilize VLAN technologies to create
    distinct logical subnets within the network, limiting lateral
    movement of threats. Tighten firewall and router configurations to
    permit only essential traffic. This granular control ensures that
    critical business operations can continue while non-essential
    traffic is restricted. Adapt firewall and routing rules dynamically
    based on the evolving security landscape, tightening or loosening
    controls as needed.

-   **Physical Segregation:** Physical segregation involves physically
    separating or segmenting nodes or hosts on a network. This ensures
    that devices are physically separate, which can enhance security by
    reducing the potential for unauthorized access.

-   **Logical Segmentation with VLANs:** Logical segmentation involves
    dividing a network into distinct segments using software-based
    configurations, such as VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks).This
    creates separate broadcast domains, security domains, and reduces
    network chatter. It allows network administrators to organize
    devices based on function or department, even if they are physically
    dispersed.

-   **Forensic Analysis:** Segmentation facilitates forensic analysis of
    the affected segments. Cybersecurity experts can conduct in-depth
    investigations within these isolated areas, gathering evidence and
    insights into the incident\'s origin, methods, and impact.

-   **Incident Resolution and Recovery:** As containment efforts succeed
    in mitigating the immediate threat, the incident enters the
    resolution and recovery phase. Segmentation remains in place to
    maintain security and prevent the re-emergence of the threat.

-   **Gradual Relaxation:** Once the incident is fully resolved,
    segmentation measures can be gradually relaxed, but it is often
    recommended to maintain some level of segmentation as an ongoing
    security practice. This is to reduce the risk of similar incidents
    in the future.

**Advantages of Segmentation:**

-   *Enhanced Security:* One of the primary advantages of segmentation
    is its ability to enhance security. By dividing the network into
    isolated segments or subnetworks, organizations create distinct
    security perimeters. This limits the scope of potential security
    breaches, making it more challenging for threats to move laterally
    within the network. Even if one segment is compromised, the others
    remain protected, reducing the overall attack surface.

-   *Efficiency:* Segmentation leads to improved network efficiency. It
    creates smaller collision domains and reduces network chatter.
    Smaller collision domains mean that network traffic is better
    organized, reducing the likelihood of collisions and improving
    overall network performance. This is particularly important in
    environments where network congestion can impact operations.

-   *Organization:* Segmentation, whether physical or logical, allows
    for the organized grouping of devices based on function, department,
    or other criteria. This organizational structure enhances network
    management and simplifies tasks such as resource allocation,
    monitoring, and access control. For example, devices within the same
    department can be logically grouped together, making it easier to
    manage policies and permissions specific to that department.

-   *Traffic Control*: Network administrators gain granular control over
    traffic flow through segmentation. Access controls, firewall rules,
    and routing policies can be implemented between segments to ensure
    that data is only accessible by authorized parties. This level of
    control helps prevent unauthorized access and data leakage while
    allowing for the secure flow of information where needed.

Segmentation works during and after containment is in place to maintain
the security of isolated areas, prevent the threat from reactivating,
and support forensic analysis and incident resolution. It is a critical
component of a comprehensive incident response strategy that helps
safeguard the network and critical assets during and after a
cybersecurity incident.

# Final Words

In today\'s cybersecurity landscape, organizations must not only focus
on prevention but also on how to respond effectively when incidents
occur. Mitigation techniques such as isolation, containment, and
segmentation are crucial tools in securing the environment after a
breach. By swiftly isolating the threat, containing the damage, and
implementing segmentation, organizations can minimize the impact of
incidents, protect their critical assets, and ensure business
continuity. Predefined procedures and the ability to adapt to evolving
threats are key to successful mitigation efforts. Cybersecurity is a
dynamic field, and staying prepared for both prevention and mitigation
is paramount in the ongoing battle against cyber threats.
