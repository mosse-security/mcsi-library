# Site Resiliency

In an age where digital operations underpin the very essence of modern enterprises, the uninterrupted availability of critical facilities has become paramount. Facilities, housing data centers, and vital IT infrastructure serve as the beating heart of organizations, facilitating their daily functions and strategic growth. Yet, in an unpredictable world where natural disasters, cyberattacks, and unforeseen disruptions can strike at any moment, the vulnerability of these facilities is all too apparent. Recognizing the profound implications of facility downtime, enterprises are increasingly turning their attention to the intricate discipline of "Site Resiliency." In this article, we address the concept of site resiliency, examining why it has become crucial for businesses as well as the important factors to take into account when choosing a site and the various types of recovery sites.

## What is Site Resiliency and Why is it Important?

Site Resiliency, in the realm of Business Continuity Planning (BCP), is the strategic approach that modern enterprises adopt to ensure the continuous operation of critical business functions by seamlessly transitioning them to an alternate facility. Using this approach, organizations establish operational continuity in the face of disruptions.

Business disruptions can be categorized into three main types: nondisasters, disasters, and catastrophes. Nondisasters represent disruptions that have significant yet confined impacts on business processes at a facility, often necessitating solutions like hardware or software restoration. Disasters, on the other hand, encompass events that render an entire facility unusable for a day or longer, requiring the activation of an alternate processing facility and the restoration of critical software and data from offsite backups. This alternate site must remain available until the primary facility is restored. Catastrophes, the most severe form of disruption, involve the destruction of the facility itself, necessitating both short-term solutions like offsite facilities and long-term plans, which may involve facility reconstruction. 

Site Resiliency is paramount for modern enterprises as it ensures their ability to navigate these diverse disruptions, enabling business continuity and minimizing the potentially devastating consequences of downtime, data loss, and operational setbacks. While disasters and catastrophes are rare, their potential impact underscores the critical importance of comprehensive site resiliency planning and preparedness.

## Key Considerations for Establishing Site Resiliency

Organizations must take several crucial considerations into account when planning for site resiliency to ensure the effective and efficient continuation of their operations:

1. **Alternative Facility Assessment:** When evaluating potential alternative facilities, organizations need to estimate the facility's ability to support their operations promptly and cost-effectively. This includes determining how quickly the facility can recover from a specific incident to reach a certain level of operational functionality. Additionally, organizations should inquire about the facility's prioritization policies in the event of a disaster, as well as the costs associated with various functions, IT infrastructure specifications, and the availability of adequate workspace for their employees.

2. **Reliability of Third-Party Providers:** For organizations that rely on third-party vendors or service providers for alternate facilities, assessing their reliability is paramount. This evaluation should encompass their performance history, the extent and location of their supply inventory, and their accessibility to supply and communication channels during emergencies. The reliability of these partners can significantly impact an organization's ability to recover swiftly and maintain operations.

3. **Offsite Backup Facility Accessibility:** In preparation for larger disasters that may render the primary facility unusable, organizations establish contracts with third-party vendors for offsite backup facilities. It is vital to ensure that these facilities are readily accessible when needed. Organizations typically pay a monthly fee to retain access rights, incurring activation fees only when the facility is actually used. Daily or hourly fees may also apply during the stay. While subscription services for backup facilities can be valuable short-term solutions, organizations should not rely on them as long-term alternatives due to cost considerations.

4. **Integration of Restoration Services:** In the event of physical damage to the primary facility, it's essential to consider the integration of restoration services alongside offsite data storage. Data alone is insufficient; it needs to be processed, which necessitates computing facilities similar to those used in normal operations. These restoration facilities should be capable of efficiently restoring critical applications and services to minimize downtime and disruptions effectively.

## Major Types of Recovery Sites

Recovery sites represent strategically designated facilities or locations that organizations rely upon to reinitiate their crucial business operations following disruptive events like disasters or facility malfunctions. These sites constitute a pivotal component within the broader framework of business continuity and site resiliency planning. Organizations typically have the option to select from three primary categories of leased or rented offsite facilities:

### Hot Sites

A hot site is a facility that an organization leases or rents, and it is fully configured and prepared to become operational within a matter of hours in the event of a disruption. Typically, the primary elements missing at a hot site are the actual data, which will be retrieved from a backup location, and the personnel needed to process that data. To ensure seamless recovery, the equipment and system software at a hot site must be entirely compatible with the data being restored from the organization's main site, avoiding any potential interoperability issues. Hot sites usually have duplicate data or a near-ready backup of the original site data which makes recovery significantly easier. Hot sites are an excellent choice for companies that prioritize the rapid availability of an operational site. They often support annual testing by the organization to verify their state of readiness. However, it's important to note that hot sites are the most expensive among the three types of offsite facilities, reflecting the high level of readiness and resources they provide.

### Warm Sites

A warm site is a facility that an organization leases or rents, typically offering partial configuration with some foundational infrastructure components like HVAC and essential infrastructure but excluding the actual computers and expensive equipment such as communication gear and servers. Essentially, it can be thought of as a step down from a hot site, as it lacks the fully replicated hardware and computers required for immediate operation. This approach is chosen because setting up an entire facility with duplicate hardware configured for immediate use is prohibitively expensive. While a warm site does provide some peripheral devices and backups, it's important to note that these backups are often several days or weeks old. Warm sites are typically designed to be operational within a few days.

Warm sites are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness and the reasonable timeframe in which they can become operational. They may be a preferred choice for organizations relying on proprietary or unique hardware and software, as they can bring their own equipment and software to the site post-disaster. However, there are drawbacks, including the need to procure, deliver, and configure much of the equipment at the warm site after the disaster. Additionally, warm-site contracts typically do not offer the annual testing capabilities available with hot-site contracts, meaning organizations cannot be as certain of returning to operational status within hours as with a hot site.

### Cold Sites

A cold site is a leased or rented facility that essentially provides the basic physical environment, including electrical wiring, air conditioning, plumbing, and flooring, but it does not supply any of the equipment or additional services required for operations. In essence, a cold site is akin to an empty data center, providing only the structural foundation for IT infrastructure. Activating and preparing a cold site for work can be a time-consuming process, often taking several weeks to complete. While a cold site may include equipment racks, dark fiber (unused fiber optic cabling), and perhaps even desks, it does not furnish any hardware or software.

Cold sites are the most cost-effective option among the three types of offsite facilities but require the most time and effort to become fully functional following a disaster. Organizations must arrange for the delivery, setup, and configuration of their computer systems and software at the cold site. Furthermore, it's important to note that a cold site does not contain any current or backup copies of the original site's data, making data restoration and recovery a critical consideration in the event of a disruption.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, site resiliency is a critical aspect of ensuring business continuity. The availability of recovery sites plays a pivotal role in mitigating the impact of disruptions. Understanding the distinctions between hot, warm, and cold sites is essential in making informed decisions about which solution best aligns with an organization's needs and recovery objectives. By carefully considering these options, organizations can proactively address potential challenges and ensure the swift restoration of operations in the face of adversity.
