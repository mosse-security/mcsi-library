# Network  Process Monitoring

Network monitoring processes are the systematic procedures and practices used by organizations and network administrators to oversee and manage their computer networks effectively. While designing and setting up networks are often the most noticeable work that a network engineer undertakes, much of the time spent in networking revolves around monitoring and optimising the network. These processes involve various tasks, from analyzing log files and scanning for vulnerabilities to monitoring network traffic and maintaining performance baselines. 

 

## Importance of network monitoring processes

The importance of network monitoring cannot be overstated - it serves several critical purposes. Firstly, it ensures the security of network infrastructure by proactively identifying and mitigating potential threats and vulnerabilities. Secondly, it aids in optimizing network performance by detecting and resolving issues that could degrade speed and reliability. Lastly, network monitoring enables organizations to adhere to compliance requirements and maintain a stable and reliable network environment. Letâ€™s take a look at some of the key processes which are commonly undertaken as part of network monitoring. 

 

**Log Reviewing**

Log reviewing involves the systematic analysis of log files generated by network devices, servers, and applications. These logs contain records of various events, errors, and activities, offering a comprehensive view of network operations. Log reviewing is critical for network security and performance management. It helps detect and respond to security incidents, troubleshoot network issues, and ensure compliance with regulatory standards. Popular log management tools include Splunk, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), and SolarWinds Log Analyzer.



**Port Scanning**

Port scanning is the methodical exploration of network devices to identify open ports and services. It involves sending connection requests to specific ports to assess their accessibility and potential vulnerabilities. Port scanning is a fundamental step in network security assessments and penetration testing. It allows network administrators to identify weaknesses in the network's defense and prioritize security measures. Tools like Nmap, Nessus, and OpenVAS are commonly used for port scanning.



**Vulnerability Scanning**

Vulnerability scanning involves automated tools that scan a network's systems, applications, and configurations to identify known security vulnerabilities. These tools compare the network's components against vulnerability databases to assess potential risks. Vulnerability scanning is crucial for proactive security management. It helps organizations prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers. Well-known vulnerability scanning tools include Qualys, Rapid7 Nexpose, and Tenable Nessus.



**Patch Management**

Patch management is the process of identifying, testing, and deploying software updates (patches) to address security vulnerabilities, software bugs, and performance issues in network devices and applications. Effective patch management is vital for maintaining network security and stability. It reduces the risk of security breaches, ensures the latest security features are in place, and minimizes downtime. Common patch management solutions include WSUS (Windows Server Update Services), SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager), and Red Hat Satellite.



**Rollback**

Rollback procedures involve creating backup configurations or system snapshots to revert network changes in case of issues or unexpected consequences during updates, upgrades, or configuration changes. Rollback capabilities provide a safety net for network administrators. They allow quick recovery from configuration errors, software updates gone wrong, or unexpected network disruptions. Network devices often have built-in rollback features, while configuration management tools like Ansible and Puppet facilitate rollback automation.



**Reviewing Baselines**

Establishing performance and security baselines involves continuously monitoring and recording network performance metrics and security events over time. This historical data serves as a reference point for normal network behavior. Baseline reviews enable network administrators to detect anomalies, identify performance bottlenecks, and spot security incidents by comparing current network activity to established norms. Network monitoring solutions like PRTG Network Monitor and Zabbix support baseline creation and analysis.



**Packet/Traffic Analysis**

Packet and traffic analysis involves capturing and examining individual network packets to gain in-depth insights into network behavior, diagnose issues, and identify security threats. Packet analysis is a versatile and powerful method for troubleshooting network problems, optimizing performance, and detecting suspicious or malicious network activity. Tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, and Cisco Packet Tracer facilitate packet and traffic analysis.

# Final Words

While they may not be the most visible work undertaken by network engineers, network monitoring processes provide organizations with the means to safeguard their data, optimize network performance, and adhere to regulatory standards. By systematically reviewing logs, scanning for vulnerabilities, managing patches, and analyzing network traffic, administrators ensure the smooth operation and longevity of their networks. Done well, however, the significance of network monitoring extends beyond just addressing issues - it empowers organizations to stay ahead of emerging threats and proactively adapt to changing network demands, giving the best possible chance of optimal network uptime and performance.
