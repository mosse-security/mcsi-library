# Cloud-native controls vs. third-party solutions

In the ever-evolving landscape of cloud security, organizations are faced with critical decisions regarding the tools and controls they employ to safeguard their cloud environments. Two primary options emerge - leveraging cloud-native controls provided by cloud service providers (CSPs) or turning to third-party security solutions. Each approach carries its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and the choice often hinges on the specific needs and objectives of the organization. In this article, we explore the characteristics, benefits, and drawbacks of both cloud native controls and third-party solutions.

 

## Cloud Native Controls


Cloud native controls refer to the security features and tools inherently integrated into the offerings of cloud service providers (CSPs). These controls are designed to protect the infrastructure, services, and data residing within a specific cloud platform.

**Advantages of Cloud Native Controls**

There are some key strengths of cloud-native controls, which can make them an attractive option â€“ these include:

- **Seamless Integration:** Cloud-native controls are tightly integrated with the cloud environment, offering a seamless user experience and simplified management.

- **Scalability:** They can scale automatically with cloud resources, adapting to changes in workload and demand.

- **Cost-Efficiency:** Often included in the base cloud service, cloud-native controls can reduce additional licensing costs.

- **Familiarity:** Organizations already familiar with the CSP's ecosystem find it easier to implement and manage these controls.

  

**Cloud Native Controls Disadvantages**

Of course, there are also some issues to consider -

- **Limited Customization:** Cloud-native controls may lack the customization options needed to address unique security requirements.
- **Vendor Lock-In:** Relying solely on CSP-provided controls can create vendor lock-in, making it challenging to migrate to other cloud providers. This may also complicate utilising a multi-cloud approach.



**An Example Scenario  - When Cloud Native is Better**
 A good example of a situation where cloud native would be better is a small start-up company with limited resources, which opts for cloud native controls when launching a new web application on a cloud platform. The ease of integration and cost-effectiveness of these controls align with the organization's budget and scalability requirements, allowing them to focus on application development without the overhead of third-party solutions. 

 

## Third-Party Solutions

Third-party solutions are security tools and software developed by independent vendors to enhance the security posture of cloud environments. These solutions offer additional layers of protection and customization beyond the native controls provided by CSPs and may have a stronger appeal to those wishing to utilise a multi-cloud approach since they can often integrate with numerous platforms. 



**Advantages of Third-Party Solutions**

The advantages of a third-party approach include:

- **Advanced Features:** Third-party solutions often provide advanced threat detection, compliance management, and customization options. This may also include interoperability with existing security solutions.

- **Multi-Cloud Compatibility:** They can be used across multiple cloud providers, enabling organizations with multi-cloud strategies to maintain consistent security measures.

- **Specialization:** Some third-party solutions specialize in specific threat vectors or compliance requirements, offering tailored protection.

- **Independent Assessment:** Organizations can benefit from an independent assessment of their cloud security, gaining insights beyond what CSPs provide.

  

**Third-Party Solutions Disadvantages**

By contrast, the issues with a third-party approach can be:

- **Complexity:** Integrating and managing multiple third-party solutions can increase complexity and require additional training.
- **Cost:** Licensing and maintenance costs for third-party solutions can be higher, particularly for organizations with extensive cloud deployments. Payments for a third-party system will be in addition to the base cloud costs.

 

**An example Scenario - When Third-Party is Better**
Third-party security solutions might be ideal for a larger financial institution operating in a highly regulated environment, which requires robust compliance and data protection capabilities across multiple cloud platforms. They opt for a third-party cloud security solution that offers granular control over encryption, access management, and compliance reporting. This choice ensures they meet stringent regulatory requirements while maintaining a high level of security. 

# Final Words

In the dynamic realm of cloud security, organizations must strike a balance between harnessing the inherent advantages of cloud-native controls and augmenting their security posture with the specialized capabilities of third-party solutions. The choice ultimately depends on factors such as organizational goals, compliance requirements, resource availability, and the specific nature of the cloud workloads being protected. By carefully evaluating these factors, organizations can develop a robust and tailored cloud security strategy that effectively safeguards their digital assets.
