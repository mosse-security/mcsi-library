# Major Types of Network Policies and Best Practices

Effective network management involves not only technical controls and monitoring, but also implementing a range of policies and best practices to ensure the security, reliability, and efficiency of network operations. These policies serve as guidelines for network administrators and users, promoting responsible and secure network behavior. In this article, we will delve into various policies and best practices that organizations should consider adopting to safeguard their network infrastructure and data.

 

## Privileged User Agreement 

A privileged user agreement outlines the responsibilities, expectations, and ethical conduct expected from individuals who have elevated privileges or administrative access to network resources.  This policy helps mitigate the risk of insider threats and unauthorized actions. It ensures that privileged users understand their roles, responsibilities, and the importance of safeguarding sensitive data. 

*Common Contents:* The policy may include guidelines on access control, password management, monitoring, and reporting requirements for privileged accounts.

 

## Password Policy  

A password policy defines the rules and requirements for creating, managing, and protecting passwords used to access network resources.  Password policies enhance network security by enforcing strong password practices and reducing the risk of unauthorized access. They promote the regular updating of passwords and discourage the use of easily guessable passwords. 

*Common Contents:* Password complexity requirements, expiration intervals, password history, and multi-factor authentication recommendations.

 

## On-boarding/Off-boarding Procedures 

On-boarding and off-boarding procedures establish the protocols for granting and revoking network access to employees during their entry or exit from an organization.  These procedures streamline the management of user accounts, ensuring that only authorized personnel have network access. They help prevent security gaps that could result from overlooked account changes. 

*Common Contents:* Account provisioning, access requests, role-based access control, and account termination processes.

 

## Licensing Restrictions 

Licensing restrictions define how software and hardware assets can be used within an organization, including limitations on redistribution, modification, and licensing compliance.  Licensing policies ensure legal compliance and cost-effective use of software and hardware resources. They prevent the organization from incurring penalties or legal consequences due to licensing violations. 

*Common Contents:* Software licensing agreements, license tracking, and restrictions on unauthorized software installations.

 

## International Export Controls 

International export control policies outline restrictions on the export, transfer, or sharing of technology, software, or data across international borders, ensuring compliance with export regulations.  These policies prevent the unauthorized export of sensitive technology or data that may be subject to export restrictions or international trade laws. 

*Common Contents:* Export control classifications, restrictions on sharing technical data with foreign entities, and procedures for obtaining export licenses.

 

## Data Loss Prevention Policies

Data loss prevention policies define measures and practices to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive data, both internally and externally.  DLP policies safeguard sensitive information, protecting it from accidental leaks or intentional data breaches. They specify data classification, encryption, and monitoring requirements. 

*Common Contents:* Data classification guidelines, encryption protocols, data handling procedures, and incident reporting processes.

 

## Remote Access Policies 

Remote access policies govern the secure and controlled access to network resources from remote locations, such as telecommuting or mobile access.  These policies ensure that remote access is secure and complies with organizational security standards, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.

*Common Contents:* Authentication requirements, secure connection protocols, device security, and remote access authorization procedures.

 

## Incident Response Policies 

Incident response policies outline the procedures and actions to be taken in the event of a security incident or data breach.  These policies enable organizations to respond swiftly and effectively to security incidents, minimizing damage and protecting sensitive data. 

*Common Contents:* Incident classification, reporting mechanisms, containment procedures, and communication protocols.



## BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) Policies

BYOD policies govern the use of personal devices, such as smartphones and laptops, for work-related tasks, ensuring that security measures are in place.  BYOD policies balance the convenience of personal device use with network security requirements, minimizing the risk of data exposure or malware infiltration. 

*Common Contents:* Device registration, security software requirements, data access controls, and acceptable use guidelines for personal devices.

 

## AUP (Acceptable Use Policy)

An AUP defines the acceptable and unacceptable behaviors of users when accessing and using network resources. AUPs promote responsible network usage, preventing misuse or abuse of resources, and maintaining a productive and secure network environment. 

*Common Contents:* Prohibited activities, bandwidth management, email usage guidelines, and penalties for policy violations.

 

## NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) 

NDAs are legally binding agreements that protect sensitive information by prohibiting its disclosure or sharing with unauthorized parties.  NDAs safeguard confidential information, particularly during collaborations, partnerships, or when sharing proprietary data with third parties. 

*Common Contents:* Definitions of confidential information, obligations of parties involved, duration of confidentiality, and dispute resolution mechanisms.

 

## System Life Cycle and Asset Disposal Policies 

Asset disposal policies outline the procedures for decommissioning, recycling, or securely disposing of hardware and electronic assets.  These policies ensure that retired equipment is properly handled, reducing the risk of data breaches and environmental impact. 

*Common Contents:* Asset inventory management, data sanitization methods, disposal guidelines, and environmental compliance.

 

## Safety Procedures and Policies 

Safety procedures and policies focus on the physical safety of individuals and the protection of network equipment and infrastructure from accidents or disasters.  These policies help prevent accidents, injuries, or damage to network components and facilities. They promote safe practices during installations, maintenance, and emergencies. 

*Common Contents:* Workplace safety guidelines, emergency response plans, fire safety protocols, and equipment handling procedures.

 

# Final Words

While policies and procedures may not be the most exciting topic, it's vital to implement and follow them - especially in an enterprise environment. Each of these policies and best practices plays a critical role in ensuring a secure, efficient, and compliant network environment, helping organizations navigate the complexities of modern network management especially when a large team of engineers and users are invloved!.
