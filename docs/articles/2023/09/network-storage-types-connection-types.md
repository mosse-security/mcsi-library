# Network storage types and Connection Types

Network storage is a key feature of modern computing environments. It’s typically used to store files which need to be accessed by multiple systems, and can provide much greater flexibility in terms of redundancy and backup. In order for network storage to function properly, the underlying network needs to be properly configured. In this article, let’s take a look at the two main types of network storage – NAS, and SAN as well as some of the common connection types they utilise. 



## Problems with local storage

Storing files on local systems, such as individual computers or on-premises servers, can have several drawbacks compared to using network storage solutions. Some key issues include:

- **Limited Accessibility and Collaboration:** Storing files on local systems restricts access to those physically present at the specific machine where the data resides. This limitation hampers collaboration and remote work capabilities, hindering the modern need for flexible and distributed teams. Team members may struggle to share, edit, or access files efficiently, leading to inefficiencies and delays in workflow.
- **Data Redundancy and Backup Challenges:** Local storage systems often lack centralized backup mechanisms, making data protection and recovery more challenging. Each device's local storage must be individually managed and backed up, increasing the risk of data loss due to hardware failures, accidents, or security breaches. In contrast, network storage solutions often come with built-in data redundancy and backup features, ensuring data integrity and recovery options.
- **Scalability and Resource Management:** Local storage resources are limited by the capacity of the individual device or server. As data requirements grow, it becomes challenging to scale storage infrastructure efficiently. Organizations may find themselves frequently upgrading hardware or juggling data across multiple devices, which can lead to resource management headaches. Network storage, especially solutions like NAS and SAN, offer scalability options, allowing for easy expansion of storage capacity to accommodate growing data needs.

While local storage still has its merits, it is often less suitable for modern organizations that require seamless collaboration, data protection, scalability, and efficient resource management. Network storage solutions, such as NAS and SAN, provide the infrastructure needed to overcome these limitations – let’s see how!

 

## Network-Attached Storage (NAS)

NAS is a dedicated storage device or file server connected to a network, providing centralized data storage and file-sharing services to multiple clients and users.
