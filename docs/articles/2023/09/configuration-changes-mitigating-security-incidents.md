# Configuration Changes: Mitigating Security Incidents 

In the realm of cybersecurity, the question is not if an incident will
occur, but when. Organizations must be prepared to respond swiftly and
effectively when confronted with a security breach. Configuration
changes play a pivotal role in mitigating security incidents, bolstering
defenses, and ensuring a resilient environment. This article explores
the strategic use of configuration changes across various security
components, including firewall rules, Mobile Device Management (MDM),
Data Loss Prevention (DLP), content filters, Uniform Resource Locators
(URL) filters, and certificate management, when an incident strikes.

## The Importance of Configuration Changes

In the aftermath of a security incident, configuration changes,
including adjustments to firewall rules, Mobile Device Management (MDM)
policies, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) settings, content filtering, URL
filtering, and certificate management, are paramount to mitigating the
damage and securing the environment. By updating firewall rules,
organizations can block malicious traffic and restrict unauthorized
access. MDM configurations allow for remote device management and
lockdown, enhancing control and reducing the risk of further breaches.
DLP and content filtering can prevent data exfiltration and enforce
security policies, while URL filtering helps in blocking access to
malicious websites. Finally, updating or revoking certificates is
crucial to thwart attackers who may have gained access through
compromised credentials. These configuration changes collectively
fortify the environment, aiding in incident recovery and preventing
future breaches.

## Firewall Rules: Fortifying the Perimeter

Firewalls are essential network security devices designed to safeguard
networks by creating a barrier between them and potential threats from
the outside world. They can take the form of either hardware or software
solutions and may be standalone devices or integrated into existing
network equipment like routers and switches.

### Purpose of Firewalls 

-   **Isolation:** The primary purpose of a firewall is to isolate one
    network from another. This separation prevents unauthorized access
    and protects sensitive data.

-   **Network Segmentation:** Firewalls can be used internally within a
    network to segment different areas, ensuring that they don\'t
    communicate with each other without proper authorization. This is
    vital in scenarios such as separating a Payment Card Industry (PCI)
    secure zone containing sensitive financial information from other
    departments.

-   **Protection Against External Threats:** Firewalls are commonly used
    to block or limit incoming traffic from the internet or external
    networks. They act as a barrier, allowing only authorized and safe
    traffic to enter.

### Firewall Types:

-   **Packet Filtering Firewalls:** These filter traffic based on
    specific ports, allowing administrators to permit or deny traffic
    based on port numbers. For example, HTTP traffic typically uses port
    80, while FTP uses port 21.

-   **Proxy Firewalls:** Proxy firewalls have two network interfaces,
    separating internal users from external networks. They can also hide
    internal IP addresses using Network Address Translation (NAT) and
    cache frequently accessed content to improve network performance.

-   **Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI) Firewalls:** SPI firewalls
    examine packets in-depth and maintain a table of active
    communication channels. They track entire conversations, ensuring
    that incoming packets match established connections, providing a
    higher level of security than packet filtering firewalls. If an
    unrecognized packet attempts to join a conversation, it is dropped.

While firewalls enhance network security, it is important to understand
that no security measure is entirely foolproof. Hackers continuously
seek vulnerabilities, and even advanced SPI firewalls can be susceptible
to attacks if their state table is overloaded. Therefore, network
security is an ongoing battle that requires constant vigilance and
adaptation to evolving threats.

### Firewall Configuration Rules

Configuration rules involve defining specific settings to control how an
organization's firewall manages network traffic. Whether a firewall is
built-in within an operating system, a standalone hardware firewall, or
a software-based firewall, the fundamental principles remain consistent.
These rules enable organizations to allow or deny access to
applications, ports, users, and IP addresses. We explore this in further
detail:

-   **Windows Firewall:** In the case of Windows 10, organizations can
    access the Windows Firewall Advanced Security settings. This
    interface allows for the configuration of various rules, including
    Inbound Rules and Outbound Rules, Connection Security Rules, and
    more.

-   **Enabling or Disabling Rules:** Specific configuration rules can be
    enabled or disabled, as needed. Enabling a rule allows traffic that
    matches the rule\'s criteria to pass through, while disabling it
    blocks such traffic. This can be done by double-clicking on a rule
    and checking or unchecking the \"Enable\" option. Traffic can also
    be implicitly denied. That is, the firewall Access Control List
    (ACL) can specify what type of traffic is allowed.

-   **Configuring Rules:** Within each rule\'s settings, several options
    exist to define the rule\'s behaviour:

    -   **Dynamic Rule Adjustments:** In response to an incident,
        dynamically adjust firewall rules to block malicious traffic or
        connections associated with the threat.

    -   **Isolation Policies:** Create isolation rules that segregate
        compromised systems from the rest of the network to prevent
        lateral movement by attackers.

    -   **Logging and Alerting:** Enhance firewall rule configurations
        to enable detailed logging and real-time alerting, aiding in
        incident detection and analysis.

    -   **Programs and Services:** Specify applications and services
        related to the rule. Connections from specific computers can be
        allowed or blocked.

    -   **Protocols and Ports:** Define the protocols and port numbers
        the rule applies to. This includes remote and local ports.

    -   **Scope**: Set the scope of the rule by specifying local and
        remote IP addresses. Specific IP addresses can be whitelisted or
        blacklisted.

    -   **Advanced:** Configure the rule\'s profile (e.g., Domain,
        Public, Private), as well as local and remote principals
        (users).

-   **Creating New Rules:** New rules can also be created from scratch.
    This is useful for allowing or denying traffic for a specific
    application, port, or IP address.

-   **Using System Settings:** Another way to configure firewall rules
    is through system settings. For example, in Windows, Remote Desktop
    can be enabled or disabled directly in the system settings. Doing so
    will automatically enable or disable corresponding firewall rules.

-   **Multiple Approaches:** It is important to note that there are
    multiple ways to configure firewall rules, and the method chosen
    depends on an organization's specific needs and familiarity with the
    firewall interface.

Configuring firewall rules involves defining how a firewall should
handle network traffic. Rules can be created to allow or deny traffic
based on various criteria, including applications, ports, IP addresses,
and users. These rules can be managed through the firewall interface or
by adjusting system settings, providing flexibility in securing a
network.
