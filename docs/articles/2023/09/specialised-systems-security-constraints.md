# Specialised Systems - Security Constraints

Specialized and embedded systems, exemplified by the Internet of Things (IoT), are transforming industries and our daily lives. These resource-constrained devices, designed for specific purposes, often operate in environments with unique limitations and challenges. While these systems offer tremendous benefits, their constrained nature also comes with a set of constraints on security that must be carefully navigated. In this article module, we will take a look at some of the issues with securing specialized and embedded systems, exploring the constraints they face and the innovative security solutions that address these challenges. 

 

## Power

Power constraints refer to the limited availability of power sources for embedded systems. Many IoT devices are designed to operate on battery power for extended periods, which limits their ability to perform resource-intensive security operations. Even where such devices are able to connect to mains power, they often need to keep their power consumption low to save resources. 

IoT devices must therefore balance the need for security with power efficiency. Implementing lightweight encryption algorithms and optimizing cryptographic operations can help conserve power. Additionally, energy-efficient authentication mechanisms, such as session resumption, can reduce the energy overhead of secure communications.

 

## Compute

Compute constraints arise from the limited processing capabilities of embedded systems. IoT devices often have limited computational resources, making it challenging to perform complex cryptographic operations or run resource-intensive security protocols.

To address compute constraints, IoT devices can prioritize efficient cryptographic algorithms and protocols that require minimal computational overhead. Lightweight security solutions, like Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), are well-suited for resource-constrained environments. Offloading security operations to cloud-based services can also help mitigate compute limitations.

 

## Network

Network constraints involve limitations in terms of network bandwidth and connectivity. IoT devices may operate in remote areas with limited network access or rely on low-bandwidth communication protocols like LPWAN.

IoT security protocols should be designed to minimize data transfer over the network while maintaining robust security. This includes using efficient compression techniques, data reduction methods, and optimizing message formats. Furthermore, ensuring secure communication even in low-bandwidth scenarios is crucial to protect data in transit.

 

## Cryptography

Cryptographic constraints relate to the challenges of implementing strong cryptographic mechanisms in resource-constrained devices. IoT devices may struggle to support advanced encryption and hashing algorithms.

IoT devices should prioritize cryptographic algorithms tailored for low-resource environments, such as symmetric encryption and lightweight hashing. Ensuring the use of secure, yet efficient, cryptographic libraries and algorithms is essential for protecting sensitive data.

 

## Inability to Patch

Many IoT devices lack the capability to receive regular software updates or patches. Once deployed, these devices may remain unchanged for extended periods, making them vulnerable to evolving threats.

To address this constraint, IoT manufacturers should focus on producing devices with built-in security features, robust initial configurations, and long-term support commitments. Implementing secure boot processes and hardware-based security features can enhance the resilience of unpatchable devices.

 

## Authentication

Authentication constraints arise from the challenge of verifying the identity of IoT devices and users in an embedded environment. Traditional authentication methods may not be feasible for resource-constrained devices.

IoT devices should implement secure and lightweight authentication methods, such as pre-shared keys (PSKs) or certificate-based authentication. Additionally, incorporating device identity management solutions can help establish trust between devices and the network.

 

## Range

Range constraints refer to limitations in the communication range of IoT devices. Some devices may operate in remote or dispersed environments where network connectivity is limited.

IoT security measures should account for the constraints of remote or wide-ranging deployments. Solutions like mesh networking, where devices relay data between each other, can extend the communication range. However, ensuring that communication remains secure as data traverses multiple devices is crucial.

 

## Cost

Cost constraints are inherent in IoT deployments, where a large number of devices are often deployed across various locations. Balancing security measures with affordability is a key consideration.

Cost-effective security solutions should be prioritized. Manufacturers should consider the trade-offs between security and cost while ensuring that essential security features are not compromised. Open-source security solutions and community-driven efforts can also contribute to cost-effective security.

 

## Implied Trust

Implied trust constraints involve the assumption that IoT devices are trusted by default, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. Users often overlook or underestimate the security risks posed by these devices.

It is crucial to educate users and device manufacturers about the importance of verifying and validating the security of IoT devices. Implementing strong security practices by design, rather than relying solely on implied trust, can help mitigate security risks associated with IoT deployments.

 

# Final words

In summary, specialized and embedded systems, especially IoT devices, face a multitude of constraints that must be carefully considered when designing and implementing security measures. Balancing security with these constraints requires creative solutions, efficient algorithms, and a proactive approach to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and threats.
