# Network  Event Management

Network event monitoring and management is an important aspect of maintaining a resilient and efficient network infrastructure. It encompasses various processes and tools designed to keep a watchful eye on network performance, security, and overall health. One fundamental aspect of this monitoring is Network Event Management, which involves the diligent tracking and response to network events and notifications. Additionally, SNMP Monitors enable remote administration and data collection from network devices, while Metrics provide quantifiable measurements to evaluate network performance. In this article, letâ€™s explore these critical components of network management.

 

## Network Event Management

Network Event Management is a crucial process in network administration that involves the systematic collection, analysis, and response to events or notifications generated by network devices and systems. These events can range from routine status updates to critical alerts indicating network issues, security breaches, or performance anomalies. The primary objective of network event management is to ensure the reliability, security, and optimal performance of the network by identifying and responding to events in a timely and effective manner. It includes the use of tools and systems to monitor, categorize, prioritize, and notify relevant stakeholders about network events, enabling proactive troubleshooting and incident resolution. Typically, we monitor a network for: 



**Notifications**

Notifications are messages or alerts generated by network devices and systems to inform administrators or stakeholders about specific events or conditions within the network. Notifications provide timely information about critical network events, such as system failures, security breaches, or resource shortages. They enable quick response and issue resolution. Notification mechanisms often include email, SMS, and push notifications.



**Alerts**

Alerts are notifications triggered by predefined thresholds or conditions. They indicate situations that require immediate attention, such as abnormal resource utilization, network congestion, or unauthorized access attempts. Alerts help network administrators proactively address emerging issues, ensuring network stability and security. They can be configured to trigger actions like automated responses or escalations to designated personnel.

 

**SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**

SIEM systems combine security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM) to provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network devices. They help organizations correlate and respond to security incidents. SIEM solutions are crucial for threat detection, incident response, and compliance monitoring. They enable organizations to identify and mitigate security threats by analyzing event data from various sources.

 

## SNMP Monitors

SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) Monitors are network management tools that utilize SNMP to gather information and control SNMP-enabled devices within a network. SNMP is a protocol that allows administrators to remotely monitor and manage network devices, such as routers, switches, and servers. SNMP monitors use predefined Management Information Bases (MIBs) to query devices for specific data, configurations, and performance metrics. They play a critical role in network administration by providing real-time insights into device status, performance, and resource utilization. SNMP monitors empower administrators to efficiently manage and maintain network infrastructure by enabling remote monitoring, configuration adjustments, and proactive issue resolution.

The SNMP Management Information Base (MIB) serves as a structured and hierarchical database that defines the parameters and attributes of network devices that can be monitored and controlled using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). MIB organizes network-related information in a tree-like structure, where each node represents a unique object or attribute associated with a network device. These objects are identified by Object Identifiers (OIDs), which are numeric labels that denote their position in the MIB hierarchy. SNMP managers use these OIDs to query devices for specific information and perform management tasks. For example, the OID "1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1" corresponds to the system's description, providing details about the device's type and manufacturer. Other examples of MIB entries include "ifInOctets" (input bytes on an interface), "ifOutOctets" (output bytes on an interface), and "sysUpTime" (system uptime). SNMP managers can use these OIDs to retrieve real-time data from SNMP-enabled devices, allowing administrators to monitor network performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.

 

## Metrics

Metrics in the context of network management refer to quantifiable measurements used to assess various aspects of network performance and health. These measurements help network administrators gauge the efficiency, reliability, and security of their network infrastructure. Network metrics encompass a wide range of parameters, including error rates, resource utilization, packet drops, and bandwidth/throughput. By regularly monitoring and analyzing these metrics, administrators can identify issues, make informed decisions, and take proactive actions to optimize network performance, troubleshoot problems, and ensure a seamless user experience. Metrics serve as essential tools for maintaining a stable and well-functioning network environment. Some common metrics include: 

**Error Rate**

Error rate metrics measure the frequency of errors or anomalies in network traffic, such as packet loss, CRC errors, or frame collisions. Monitoring error rates helps identify issues affecting network reliability and data integrity. High error rates may indicate hardware problems or network congestion.



**Utilization**

Utilization metrics assess the extent to which network resources are used. This includes monitoring CPU, memory, and bandwidth utilization. Utilization metrics help network administrators allocate resources effectively, ensure optimal performance, and identify potential bottlenecks or overutilized components.



**Packet Drops**

Packet drop metrics track the number of packets discarded or lost during transmission, often due to network congestion or buffer overflows. Monitoring packet drops assists in diagnosing network issues, optimizing network configurations, and maintaining smooth data transfer.



**Bandwidth/Throughput**

Bandwidth and throughput metrics measure the capacity and actual data transfer rate of a network connection. Monitoring bandwidth and throughput ensures that network performance aligns with user expectations. It aids in capacity planning, quality of service (QoS) management, and resource optimization.

# Final words

Network event management, SNMP monitoring, and metrics are essential components of proactive network management. They enable organizations to maintain security, optimize resource usage, and troubleshoot network issues efficiently, ultimately contributing to a reliable and high-performing network infrastructure.
