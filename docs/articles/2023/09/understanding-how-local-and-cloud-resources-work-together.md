# Understanding How Local and Cloud Resources Work Together

In today's technology-driven world, the cloud has emerged as a powerful solution, offering a multitude of advantages for businesses. It basically provides a platform for running applications, load balancing, and the convenience of storing vast amounts of data, all while letting cloud providers handle the complexities of scaling. While economically advantageous, the coexistence of local and cloud resources can sometimes pose challenges. 
In this article, we'll explore how local and cloud resources work together to strengthen IT infrastructure. 

Let's delve into the details of this relationship, understand how they smoothly enhance business operations and key points to consider when dealing with both local and cloud resources.

## Key Considerations for Local and Cloud Resource Management

**Data Backup**: You can enhance your disaster recovery capabilities by utilizing cloud resources for backups. Storing critical data in the cloud provides an extra layer of security, as it ensures that vital information is not solely reliant on physical on-premises storage. This mitigates risks in case of a disaster, ensuring that essential data remains accessible even if your local infrastructure is compromised.

**Redundancy and Synchronization** : When you work with both local and cloud resources, an important thing to consider is having copies of your data in more than one place. This is helpful if something goes wrong because it means you can still get your data back. But, it can also be tricky when you want to make sure you're using the newest version of your data. To make things smoother, keep your files up to date and make sure your local and cloud data always match.

**Hybrid Cloud Model** : In many business networks, using a mix of both local and cloud resources has become common. This means some applications are kept on the company's private cloud (like files), while others are on the public cloud (like websites).

When you decide where to put your resources—locally or in the cloud—think carefully. For example, it's a good idea to keep local backups on your own servers because they're meant for local use. However, using the cloud for monthly backups ensures your data is safe, even if something happens to your local servers.

**Cloud Bursting and Scalability** : Cloud Bursting refers to a strategy where you leverage the capabilities of the public cloud to enhance your existing local resources. Specifically, it addresses the need for scalability and resource flexibility within the dynamic landscape of IT infrastructure.

When you experience temporary spikes in computing power demands, such as during high-demand periods like holiday seasons, special sales events, financial analysis, processing backlogs, cloud bursting becomes highly valuable. Instead of investing in expensive local infrastructure that would remain underutilized during non-peak times, you can tap into the virtually limitless resources of the public cloud. This allows you to quickly and cost-effectively scale your computing power to meet these temporary demands without the delays and costs associated with acquiring and provisioning additional on-premises hardware.

**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: When you're considering the implementation of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), it's essential to take several factors into account to make informed decisions. Here's a breakdown of what you should consider:

* <u>Geographical Location of Users:</u> The geographical distribution of your user base plays a crucial role in VPC implementation. You'll want to choose the location of your VPC servers strategically to minimize latency and optimize user experience. Selecting data center locations that are closer to your primary user demographics can significantly improve the speed and responsiveness of your applications and services.

* <u>Resource Duration:</u> Determine how long you anticipate needing the resources provided by the VPC. Consider whether your resource needs are short-term or long-term. If you expect resource requirements to be temporary, it might be more cost-effective to utilize the public cloud for these resources rather than investing in the purchase and maintenance of physical equipment.

* <u>Local vs. Public Cloud:</u> Evaluate whether it's more beneficial to procure and maintain your own equipment or leverage the resources offered by the public cloud. This decision should align with your organization's specific needs, budget constraints, and scalability requirements. Keep in mind that utilizing the public cloud can provide flexibility and scalability without the capital expenditures associated with purchasing and managing physical hardware.

Making informed decisions in these areas will enable you to optimize your VPC strategy to meet your organization's specific goals and requirements effectively.

## Final Words

Both local and cloud resources come with their unique set of advantages and disadvantages. Local resources are cheaper and give you more control over security, but you need to manage them physically. Cloud resources, while providing easy internet accessibility and cost-effective storage, can incur expenses based on usage, rely on internet connectivity, and require careful consideration of compliance requirements.

In the end, using local and cloud resources isn't all or nothing. It's about finding the right mix to get the most benefits while handling the challenges. By carefully evaluating resource needs, costs, and the potential for savings, organizations can strike the right balance, leveraging the best of both local and cloud-based solutions to drive their success in the digital age.
