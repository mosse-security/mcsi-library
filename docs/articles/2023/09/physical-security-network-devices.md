# Physical Security - Network Devices

Physical security is a critical aspect of network security. While network administrators often focus on securing data and access controls electronically, it's equally vital to protect the physical infrastructure and assets that comprise the network â€“ after all, if an attacker can access your actual devices, many of your technical and logical controls have little value! . This article covers the key aspects and examples of physical security, including detection and prevention measures in the contact of networking and network devices. 

 

## Detection Methods

Detective controls are those which help us to identify a possible security incident in progress - in terms of networking, there are several key ones to consider. 



**Motion Detection**

Motion detection systems use sensors to identify movement in restricted areas. It can be deployed in server rooms, data centers, and other sensitive areas to trigger alarms or notifications when unauthorized individuals enter.

For an example, consider a situation where an unauthorized individual gains access to a server room, potentially compromising sensitive equipment. The security weakness here is the lack of awareness regarding unauthorized access, which can be mitigated by installing motion detection sensors at the server room entrance. These sensors trigger alarms or notifications when movement is detected, instantly alerting security personnel and thwarting unauthorized access.

 

**Video Surveillance**

Video surveillance involves the use of cameras to monitor and record activities in and around the network facility. Video surveillance provides real-time monitoring and a historical record of events, aiding in incident investigation and deterrence. For an example, envision an employee attempting to steal a networking switch from the data center. The security weakness lies in the absence of evidence to identify the perpetrator. To address this, video cameras strategically placed in the data center capture theft attempts in real-time, providing clear visual evidence for investigation and serving as a deterrent against potential thieves.

 

**Asset Tracking Tags**

Asset tracking tags are devices attached to valuable equipment or assets to monitor their location. Tracking tags are essential for tracking the movement of networking equipment and ensuring that they remain in designated secure areas. 

Asset Tracking Tags come into play when considering scenarios involving the unauthorized removal of valuable networking equipment from a network closet. Without asset tracking tags, it can be challenging to track the whereabouts of such equipment. However, by attaching asset tracking tags to networking gear, administrators can monitor their real-time locations, significantly reducing the risk of theft or unauthorized removal.

 

**Tamper Detection**

Tamper detection systems are designed to alert when unauthorized access or tampering with equipment or cabling occurs.Tamper detection is crucial for protecting networking infrastructure from physical attacks or tampering, such as cable cutting or unauthorized port access.

Imagine an attacker attempting to tamper with network cables. The security weakness here is the possibility of unauthorized physical access or tampering going unnoticed. Implementing tamper detection sensors on network cabinets addresses this concern. These sensors trigger alarms or alerts when the cabinet is opened, ensuring immediate notification of unauthorized access or tampering attempts.

 

## Prevention Methods

Preventative controls are a means to (At least attempt) to stop a wrongdoer from carrying out a given activity. In terms of networking they can include: 



**Badges**

Badges, often equipped with RFID or magnetic strips, are issued to authorized personnel for access control. Access badges are commonly used to restrict entry to network facilities. Unauthorized individuals without the appropriate badge cannot gain physical access.

The use of Badges is effective in restricting entry to authorized personnel only, such as to the network or server room. Think of an intruder attempting to enter a secure data center without proper authorization. In this situation, the security weakness is the lack of authentication, which can be mitigated by requiring access badges equipped with RFID or magnetic strips for entry. Unauthorized individuals without the appropriate badge are denied access.

 

**Biometrics**

Biometric security systems use unique physical or behavioral traits for identity verification. Biometric authentication methods, such as fingerprint or retina scans, provide a high level of security and are used for access control to sensitive areas.

For an example, consider a scenario where an employee's access card is stolen, potentially granting unauthorized access. The security weakness here arises from over-reliance on card-based access control. To enhance security, biometric authentication, such as fingerprint scanning, can be employed to supplement card-based access control. Even if an attacker manages to steal a card, they cannot gain access without the authorized user's biometric data.

 

**Smart Cards**

Smart cards are credit-card-sized devices containing integrated circuits that can store data and provide authentication. They are often used in combination with PINs to enhance access control. They can also store encryption keys and user credentials.

To understand the benefit of Smart Cards, imagine an unauthorized person obtaining an employee's access credentials. The security weakness is the risk of unauthorized use of these credentials. Smart cards containing encrypted data and user credentials provide added security. Even if an attacker acquires login information, access to the network remains impossible without the physical smart card.

 

**Key Fobs**

Key fobs are small devices that generate one-time passwords or access codes. Key fobs enhance security by requiring users to possess the physical device and enter the displayed code for access. They are commonly used in two-factor authentication (2FA).

In scenarios where Key Fobs are in use, think of an employee's password being compromised, potentially leading to unauthorized access. The security weakness here results from over-reliance on password-based authentication. Key fobs, generating one-time passwords or access codes, add an extra layer of security. Even if an attacker knows the password, they cannot gain access without the current key fob-generated code.

 

**Locks**

Physical locks, such as electronic or mechanical locks, are used to secure doors, cabinets, and server racks. Despite being simple, locks are a fundamental physical security measure, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access critical areas or networking equipment.

Envision a scenario where an unauthorized person gains access to a network closet and disrupts network connections, highlighting the lack of physical protection for networking equipment. To address this, implementing electronic or mechanical Locks on server racks or network closets is crucial. These locks prevent unauthorized access and ensure the physical security of essential equipment. 

# Final words

Physical security is an integral component of network security. By implementing robust detection and prevention methods, network administrators can protect their infrastructure, data, and assets from unauthorized access and tampering. Understanding and applying these physical security measures is essential for maintaining the integrity and availability of network resources.
