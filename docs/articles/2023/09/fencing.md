# Fencing 

Fencing is a fundamental component of physical security, serving as a barrier to deter and prevent unauthorized access, safeguarding perimeters, and protecting valuable assets. When we think of physical security, fencing is very often the first control that comes to mind. Understanding the various types of fencing, their purposes, and considerations in their deployment is essential for security professionals seeking to establish comprehensive physical security measures.

 

## Security Fencing

Security fencing refers to the installation of barriers designed to enclose an area and control access. These barriers range from simple chain-link fences to more sophisticated anti-climb or crash-rated fencing systems. The choice of fencing depends on the security requirements and the level of deterrence needed. 

### Types of Security Fencing

Different types of security fencing are available, each offering specific features and levels of protection – some common choices include: 

- **Chain-Link Fencing:** Chain-link fences are common and cost-effective. While they provide basic security, they are relatively easy to breach. Additional measures like barbed wire can enhance security.

- **Ornamental Fencing:** Ornamental fencing combines aesthetics with security. These fences are designed to enhance the appearance of a property while still providing a deterrent against unauthorized access. The drawback is usually a much higher cost. 

- **Anti-Climb Fencing:** These fences incorporate features that make scaling them difficult, such as curved or pointed tops and tight mesh spacing. They are ideal for deterring intruders attempting to climb over.

- **High-Security Fencing:** High-security fencing, often made of steel or reinforced materials, offers robust protection. It can withstand cutting, ramming, and other intrusion attempts.

- **Crash-Rated Fencing:** Crash-rated fencing is designed to prevent vehicular intrusion. It is commonly used around critical infrastructure and government facilities to protect against vehicle-borne threats.

  

### Key Considerations for Security Fencing

When deploying security fencing, several considerations are crucial:

- **Perimeter Assessment:** Conduct a thorough assessment of the perimeter to determine the appropriate type and placement of fencing. Identify vulnerable areas and access points.
- **Aesthetics vs. Security:** Balance security needs with aesthetics, especially in commercial and residential areas, to avoid creating an unwelcoming environment.
- **Access Control Integration:** Integrate access control systems, gates, and surveillance cameras with the fencing to create a layered security approach.
- **Maintenance:** Regular maintenance ensures that the fencing remains effective. Check for damage, corrosion, and any potential breaches. Failure to properly maintain fencing can degrade its deterrent factor as well as its ability to maintain a secure perimeter. 

 

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Security Fencing

Security fencing is a widely adopted physical security measure, offering both advantages and disadvantages. Understanding these can help security professionals make informed decisions when selecting and implementing fencing solutions.

### Advantages of Security Fencing

- **Deterrence:** Fencing serves as a visual deterrent, discouraging unauthorized individuals from attempting to breach a secured perimeter. The presence of a barrier alone can significantly reduce the likelihood of intrusion.
- **Access Control:** Fencing provides a clear boundary and controlled access points. Access can be regulated through gates and access control systems, allowing for the screening of individuals and vehicles.
- **Perimeter Protection:** Fencing offers perimeter protection, helping to secure the outer boundaries of a property or facility. This is essential for controlling who enters and exits the area.
- **Asset Protection:** Fencing safeguards valuable assets, equipment, and property from theft, vandalism, and unauthorized use.
- **Privacy:** Fencing can provide privacy for individuals and organizations by restricting visibility from outside observers.
- **Customization:** Fencing solutions come in various materials and designs, allowing organizations to choose options that match their security requirements and aesthetic preferences.

### Disadvantages of Security Fencing

- **Cost:** Depending on the type and materials used, security fencing can be expensive to purchase, install, and maintain. High-security fencing, in particular, can be a significant capital investment.
- **Maintenance:** Fencing requires ongoing maintenance to remain effective. Regular inspections, repairs, and repainting may be necessary, adding to the overall cost.
- **False Sense of Security:** Relying solely on fencing for security can create a false sense of security. Determined intruders may find ways to breach or bypass the fence, especially if it lacks additional security measures.
- **Access Limitations:** While fencing controls access, it can also restrict movement for legitimate users, causing inconveniences and delays, especially in high-traffic areas.
- **Aesthetics:** In some cases, security fencing can detract from the aesthetics of an environment, making it appear unwelcoming or prison-like.
- **Vulnerabilities:** Depending on the type and quality of fencing, vulnerabilities can exist. For example, chain-link fencing is vulnerable to cutting, while some anti-climb fencing can be defeated with specialized tools.

 

## Access Points and Gates in Security Fencing

Access points and gates are essential components of security fencing systems – arguably, they are more important than the fencing itself, since personnel and visitors must be admitted somewhere, and this must be done securely – otherwise, the entire system falls apart. 

### Types of Access Points

Access points are designated locations within a security fence where individuals and vehicles can enter or exit a secured area. These access points are often equipped with gates and access control systems. Common types of access points include:

- **Pedestrian Gates:** Pedestrian gates are designed for individuals on foot. They are typically narrower than vehicle gates and may have turnstiles or card readers for access control.

- **Vehicle Gates:** Vehicle gates are wide enough to accommodate cars, trucks, and other vehicles. They can be manual or automated and are often used at entrances to parking lots, facilities, or industrial sites.

- **Emergency Exits:** Emergency exits provide a quick means of egress in case of fire or other emergencies. These exits may be alarmed or monitored to prevent unauthorized use.

- **Service Gates:** Service gates are designed for authorized personnel, such as maintenance workers, to access specific areas of a facility without going through the main entrance.

- **Visitor Gates:** Visitor gates are commonly used at controlled entry points where security personnel can screen and verify the identity of visitors before granting access.

  

### Gate Options

Gates are the physical barriers that control access through access points. Various gate options are available to meet specific security needs:

- **Swing Gates:** Swing gates open and close like a door, pivoting on hinges. They are suitable for pedestrian access points and smaller vehicle entrances.

- **Sliding Gates:** Sliding gates move horizontally along a track to open and close. They are often used for larger vehicle entrances and areas with limited space for swing gates.

- **Automatic Gates:** Automatic gates can be controlled remotely or through access control systems. They provide convenience for authorized users and can be integrated with vehicle identification systems.

- **Manual Gates:** Manual gates are operated by individuals, typically using a key, code, or card reader. They are common for pedestrian access points and smaller facilities.

- **Turnstiles:** Turnstiles are designed to allow one person to pass at a time. They are often used at high-security entrances and can be configured with access control technology.

  

### Importance of Access Points and Gates

Access points and gates are critical for maintaining security and controlling movement within a fenced area. Here are some key reasons why they are important:

- **Access Control:** Gates serve as controlled entry and exit points, allowing authorized individuals to pass while deterring unauthorized access.

- **Visitor Screening:** Access points with gates are ideal for screening and verifying the identity of visitors before granting entry, enhancing security.

- **Emergency Egress:** Access points also provide safe means of egress during emergencies, ensuring that occupants can exit quickly when needed.

- **Integration:** Access points and gates can be integrated with access control systems, surveillance cameras, and intercoms to create a comprehensive security solution.

- **Traffic Flow:** Vehicle gates and access points help manage the flow of traffic, ensuring smooth entry and exit for authorized vehicles.

  

## Choosing the Right Fencing Solution

To make an informed decision when implementing security fencing, security professionals need to consider the specific security needs, budget, and operational requirements of the organization. It's often advisable to combine fencing with other security measures, such as surveillance cameras, access control systems, and security personnel, to create a layered security approach that addresses both advantages and disadvantages.

Ultimately, the choice of fencing should align with the organization's security objectives and risk assessment, striking a balance between security, cost, and functionality.

# Final Words

Security fencing is an essential aspect of physical security, providing a critical layer of protection for perimeters and assets. By understanding the various types of fencing, their purposes, and considerations in their deployment, security professionals can establish effective security measures that deter unauthorized access, safeguard valuable assets, and contribute to the overall security posture of an organization at a price point which makes sense for the risk profile at hand.
