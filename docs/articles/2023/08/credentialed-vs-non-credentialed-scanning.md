# Credentialed versus Non-Credentialed Scanning 

Vulnerability scanning plays a pivotal role in identifying weaknesses and potential entry points for attackers. However, not all vulnerability scanning approaches are created equal. Two primary methods, credentialed and non-credentialed scanning, offer distinct advantages and challenges in assessing network security. In this article, we will explore the differences between credentialed and non-credentialed scanning, along with relevant examples to illustrate their applications and significance in safeguarding critical assets. 

## Credentialed Scanning

Credentialed scanning, also known as authenticated scanning, involves using valid credentials (such as usernames and passwords) to access the target system or network. By using authorized credentials, the scanning tool gains elevated privileges, allowing for a more in-depth and accurate assessment of the system's security posture. This approach enables the scanner to access sensitive files, configurations, and services that are not visible during non-credentialed scanning. 

### Advantages of Credentialed Scanning: 

**a. Comprehensive Assessment:** Credentialed scanning provides a comprehensive view of the target system, including hidden or restricted areas that non-credentialed scans cannot access. 

**b. Accurate Identification of Vulnerabilities:** With elevated privileges, credentialed scans can accurately detect vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, reducing false positives and false negatives. 

**c. Compliance Auditing:** Credentialed scanning is particularly valuable for compliance auditing, as it allows organizations to assess security configurations as required by industry standards and regulations. 

## Example of Credentialed Scanning: 

A credentialed scan of an enterprise network might involve using administrative credentials to access each network device, server, and workstation. This level of access enables the scanner to retrieve detailed information about installed software, services running on each device, and configuration settings. Consequently, the assessment provides a more thorough understanding of potential security risks and enables organizations to prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities effectively. 

## Non-Credentialed Scanning

Non-credentialed scanning, also known as unauthenticated scanning, involves probing the target system or network without using any credentials. This scanning approach typically relies on publicly available information, network services, and open ports to identify vulnerabilities and assess security weaknesses. 

### Advantages of Non-Credentialed Scanning: 

**a. Minimal Impact on Systems:** Non-credentialed scanning is less likely to cause disruptions to systems or trigger any unintended consequences that may arise from using credentials. 

**b. Quick Initial Assessment:** Non-credentialed scanning allows for a rapid initial assessment of the network's security posture without requiring detailed access credentials. 

**c. External Vulnerability Assessment:** Non-credentialed scanning is useful for evaluating the security of externally facing systems or services that do not permit direct access or authentication. 

### Example of Non-Credentialed Scanning: 

An organization's cybersecurity team may employ non-credentialed scanning to assess the security of their publicly accessible web servers. By probing open ports, analyzing server banners, and examining publicly available information, the team can identify potential vulnerabilities that are visible to external entities, such as outdated software versions, open ports, or misconfigured services. 

## Choosing the Right Approach

Selecting the appropriate scanning approach depends on several factors, including the organization's security requirements, network architecture, and risk management strategy. 

### When to Use Credentialed Scanning

For comprehensive internal assessments: Credentialed scanning is ideal for in-depth internal assessments of network devices, servers, and workstations, allowing organizations to identify and address vulnerabilities that may not be visible externally. 

For compliance audits: Credentialed scanning is valuable for compliance audits, as it enables organizations to validate security configurations and settings required by industry standards and regulations. 

### When to Use Non-Credentialed Scanning

For quick external assessments: Non-credentialed scanning is useful for conducting rapid external assessments of publicly accessible systems and services from an outsider's perspective. 

When access credentials are limited: Non-credentialed scanning can be used when access credentials are not available or practical to use, allowing organizations to obtain an initial overview of potential vulnerabilities. 

## Conclusion

Vulnerability scanning is a critical component of a robust cybersecurity strategy, helping organizations identify and remediate potential weaknesses in their networks and systems. Credentialed scanning and non-credentialed scanning are two distinct approaches, each offering unique advantages in different scenarios. A well-balanced vulnerability assessment strategy may incorporate both approaches to gain a comprehensive understanding of network security posture, combining the accuracy of credentialed scanning with the efficiency of non-credentialed scanning. By leveraging the strengths of each approach, organizations can strengthen their defenses, proactively address vulnerabilities, and safeguard their critical assets against evolving cyber threats
