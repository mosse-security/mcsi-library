# Drones as Cyber Security Tools

Drones are all the rage at the moment – while they started out being used mainly for leisure, drones have quickly become a fantastic tool for everything from mapping remote terrain to search and rescue. Drones also have uses in the security sphere and can help to augment human capacity in areas such as surveillance, response, and data collection. These unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer an unprecedented vantage point, extending traditional security measures and extending their reach into previously inaccessible territories. 

 

## Surveillance and Monitoring

Drones have redefined the concept of surveillance by elevating it to new heights - quite literally. Equipped with high-resolution cameras and sensors, drones provide a real-time, bird's-eye view of large areas, perimeters, and facilities. This aerial perspective enhances situational awareness, enabling security personnel to identify anomalies, potential threats, and breaches in a timely manner. Drones are particularly valuable in critical infrastructure sectors, such as energy, transportation, and utilities, where continuous monitoring is paramount to ensuring operational integrity. The flexible way in which drones can be deployed means they also help in mitigating failures, perhaps of static CCTV cameras, in real-time. 

 

## Security Patrolling and Intrusion Detection

Automated patrolling is a domain where drones excel, effortlessly covering extensive grounds and performing routine security checks. Deployed in regular intervals, drones can monitor perimeters, fences, and sensitive zones, reporting any unusual activities to security personnel. By providing a dynamic and unpredictable presence, drones can deter potential intruders and enhance the efficiency of human security teams.

 

## Network monitoring

Believe it or not, drones can even be used for network monitoring – especially in outdoor spaces, a drone can cover an area checking for the presence of, for example, rogue access points much faster than a human could.

 

## Offensive uses for drones

While Drones offer much to defenders, offensive teams (hopefully legitimate pentesters!) can also use them to great advantage. Drones can be excellent tools for gathering OSINT, for exploring otherwise inaccessible areas and, as mentioned above, perhaps even for capturing network traffic.

In fact, there’s even a term for this - using a drone to fly over a facility and capture wireless network traffic is called “war flying”. A drone can, for example, fly up to the top of a building, land on the roof and start to capture network traffic. While it’s true that in the past a drone flying past may well have caught the attention of workers or security personnel, in many urban areas today it’s not at all an uncommon site!

*Tip: The term war flying is a derivative of the older term “war driving” – war driving is the practice of driving around in a car attempting to capture network traffic from unsecured networks. If you search online, you can even find maps of access points collated by “war drivers”.* 

 

## Challenges and Considerations

While drones offer transformative advantages, their integration into security strategies necessitates addressing certain challenges. These include: 

### Regulatory Compliance

The evolving regulatory landscape governing drone usage demands strict adherence to aviation regulations and privacy laws. Organizations must navigate airspace restrictions, obtain necessary permits, and ensure data protection when capturing and transmitting imagery. In areas where there is a high density of air traffic, the use of drones may simply be illegal. 

### Cybersecurity

Drones are not immune to cybersecurity threats. The communication channels between drones and control systems can be vulnerable to hacking, potentially compromising data and control over the device. Robust encryption, regular updates and secure communication protocols are imperative.

### Data Privacy

Aerial surveillance raises concerns about privacy violations, particularly when drones capture images of private properties or individuals without consent. Stringent privacy policies and transparent communication with stakeholders are crucial to mitigate these concerns. 

### Environmental Impact

The proliferation of drones raises environmental concerns related to noise pollution, energy consumption, and potential disruptions to wildlife. Implementing eco-friendly drone technologies and adhering to responsible operational practices can help mitigate these impacts but businesses may again be impacted by their proximity to protected wildlife areas, where drones may again be banned. 

### Increased Cost

While many drones are capable of operating autonomously, it’s more usual for a human operator to be required to fly (or at least monitor) the drone. Many organisations are also hesitant to adopt fully automated drones due to the possible cost of lawsuits arising from a drone gone awry. Because of this, a drone program often does not promise cost savings in the way that alternative technologies, such as remote sentries may do. 

 

## Anti-Drone Technologies

In addition to utilising their own drones, many organisations have started to invest in Anti-drone technologies, designed to disable hostile drones overflying their facilities. These technologies now include a wide range of solutions designed to detect, track, and mitigate unauthorized drone activities. From radio frequency jammers and signal disruptors to advanced radar systems and drone-catching nets, the landscape of anti-drone technologies is diverse and rapidly evolving. These measures address concerns such as privacy breaches, security breaches, and potential disruptions in critical environments – but of course, as fast as anti-drone technologies appear, countermeasures for drones will also evolve!

 

## People and drones

Finally, an important area to consider when employing drones is the interaction between drones and people. The obvious point, that drones must never be allowed to crash into or otherwise injure a person, is of course always a big concern – however, organisations wishing to operate drones for security purposes also need to consider the way people *react* to drones and their usage. People tend to have one of two reactions to drones – they either think they’re “cool” or they think they're “creepy”. Many people simply do not like the idea of a drone hovering above watching their every move – for a company which needs to encourage people to visit its place of business, this could be a major problem!

 

## Final Words

Drones have transcended their origins as recreational gadgets to become indispensable tools for all sorts of applications – from first responders to security professionals there are uses for drones. Their agility, versatility, and ability to provide real-time insights have significantly elevated security strategies across industries, whilst also widening the threat landscape. As technology continues to advance, organizations must look to harness the power of drones while addressing regulatory, privacy, and security challenges – and setting their use in an appropriate context based on business needs.
