# Access Control Vestibules

Access control vestibules are one of those security features which sound complicated, but actually, they're quite simple (although very effective). Access control vestibule is a term which encompasses various types of controlled entry points to a building or area which can help prevent unauthorized access, enhance visitor screening, and protect sensitive environments. Understanding the purpose, design considerations, and benefits of access control vestibules is useful for security professionals, even if physical security isn't your area of specialism. 



## What are Access Control Vestibules

Access control vestibules are enclosed areas positioned at entry points to a building or area. While you may well not realise it, you’ve almost certainly used one recently! Their primary purpose is to create a controlled transition space between the outside environment and the secured interior. Most often they take the form of an entrance to a building, but they can be used inside a facility to protect access to a high-security area, for example.  This controlled environment allows for thorough screening of individuals before granting them access to sensitive areas and improves the opportunity for complementary controls such as security guards or camera systems to function optimally. 



## Key Features and Benefits

Access control vestibules offer several key features and benefits that contribute to overall security

**- Visitor Screening:** Vestibules ensure that those who want to enter an area must pass a security checkpoint – this enables security personnel to conduct visitor screenings, including identification verification and security checks, before granting access to the main facility.

**- Two-Phase Authentication :** The two-phase entry process (entry into the vestibule followed by entry into the facility) adds an extra layer of security, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

**- Climate Control :** Vestibules can help maintain climate control within a facility by minimizing the transfer of outside air when doors are opened. This is especially important in buildings such as datacenters which have strict climate control requirements. 

**- Reduction of Tailgating :** Vestibules discourage (and may totally prevent) tailgating, a common practice where unauthorized individuals follow authorized personnel into secured areas. 

**- Parcel Screening :** For buildings with heightened security requirements (for example, government buildings), vestibules can include parcel screening equipment to detect and prevent the entry of prohibited items.

  

## Design Considerations

Creating an effective access control vestibule requires careful consideration of various design elements. These include - 

**- Physical Layout :** The vestibule layout should promote a one-way flow of traffic, ensuring that individuals cannot bypass the security screening process.

**- Access Control Systems :** Integrate access control systems, such as card readers or biometric devices, to control the doors leading from the vestibule to the main facility.

**- Surveillance :** Implement video surveillance within the vestibule to monitor and record visitor interactions and screening procedures.

**- Intercom Systems :** Install intercom systems to allow communication between security personnel and visitors during the screening process.

**- Emergency Egress :** It is also critical to design the vestibule to include emergency egress routes in case of evacuation.

## Types of Access Control Vestibules

Access control vestibules can be tailored to fit specific security needs - 

**- Mantrap Vestibules :** These vestibules have two interlocking doors that can only be opened one at a time, ensuring that only one individual can enter or exit at a time.

**- Revolving Door Vestibules :** Revolving doors provide an additional layer of security by allowing only one person to enter or exit the facility at a time while maintaining a controlled airflow.

**- Airlock Vestibules :** These vestibules are designed to minimize the transfer of air between the exterior and interior, helping with climate control and energy efficiency.

  

## Best Practices for Implementation

Implementing access control vestibules effectively requires adherence to best practices – if poorly implemented the access control features may still work, but the vestibule could impede the flow of people who have legitimate needs to access the building. Therefore, it’s also essential to consider - 

**- User-Friendly Design :** Ensure that the vestibule design is user-friendly and intuitive – this is especially the case if the vestibule is not manned during parts of or during the whole day.  

**- Accessibility :** Design vestibules to be compliant with accessibility standards, ensuring that individuals with disabilities can easily navigate them. Some vestibule types (eg revolving doors) may not be very easy for an individual in a wheelchair to use. In this case, it’s necessary to ensure that there is an alternative entry method (and that emergency egress methods are also suitable for those with disabilities) 

**- Staff Training :** Properly train security personnel to efficiently and respectfully conduct visitor screenings. Visitor screening should always be proportionate to the security of the environment. 

**- Regular Maintenance :** Conduct regular maintenance to ensure that access control systems, doors, and security equipment are functioning correctly.

**- Failure mode :** How a system will operate in the event of a failure is also a key concern. An organisation may opt for a “fail-closed” system, which will lock down in the event of a failure or a “fail-open” system, which will open if a failure occurs. “Fail closed” systems are more secure – an attacker cannot gain access by attempting to cause a failure, but they can also be a significant hindrance to operations. A failed automatic door could prevent the workforce from being able to access a critical area! By contrast, a “fail open” system allows access in the event of an issue but does present a possible avenue which could be exploited. 

## Final Words

Access control vestibules are valuable physical security mechanisms which can enhance security while controlling access to sensitive areas within buildings and facilities. By providing a controlled transition space for visitor screening and two-phase authentication, these vestibules contribute significantly to overall security strategies.
