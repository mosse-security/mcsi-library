# Vulnerability Scans

Vulnerability scans are systematic security assessments conducted on computer systems, networks, and applications to pinpoint potential security weaknesses and flaws. These scans mostly involve the use of specialized tools to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access, compromise data, or disrupt services. By examining system configurations, software versions, and network architecture, vulnerability scans offer a proactive approach to security by highlighting areas that require attention or mitigation. These assessments provide organizations with insights into their security posture, enabling them to take timely actions to patch or address these weaknesses before they can be exploited. This article delves into fundamental concepts, key considerations, and the pivotal role played by vulnerability scanning.

## False Positives and False Negatives

False positives and false negatives are common outcomes in vulnerability scanning that relate to the accuracy of the scan results. External factors can introduce errors in vulnerability scan measurements such as network conditions, firewall rules, or complex computing environments.  

False positives occur when a vulnerability scan wrongly identifies a vulnerability that doesn't exist in the system. In other words, the scan produces a result indicating a potential security issue when there isn't one. This can lead to wasted time and resources as IT teams investigate and attempt to remediate non-existent vulnerabilities. For example, a vulnerability scanner might mistakenly flag a legitimate software component as vulnerable due to misinterpretation of version numbers or configurations. False negatives occur when a vulnerability scan fails to detect an actual vulnerability that exists in the system. This is more concerning, as it implies that a potential security risk is overlooked, leaving the system susceptible to exploitation. For instance, a vulnerability related to a specific software version might go undetected if the scanner isn't updated to recognize that specific vulnerability.

## Log Reviews

Log reviews play a crucial role in vulnerability scanning by providing contextual insights and real-time data that enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of the scans. By analyzing logs generated from various systems, applications, and network activities, organizations can identify anomalous behaviors, potential attack patterns, and signs of exploitation. These insights aid in fine-tuning vulnerability scans to focus on areas highlighted by the logs, ensuring that the scanning process targets relevant and potentially risky areas. Moreover, log reviews enable the detection of vulnerabilities that might not be directly identified by automated scans, enhancing the overall security posture by addressing both known and emerging threats.

It is important to note that log systems must be properly configured. It is because they define what events are recorded and in what detail. Without correct configuration, logs may omit critical information or become inundated with irrelevant data, compromising their usefulness for identifying security incidents and vulnerabilities.

## Credentialed vs. Non-Credentialed Scans

Credentialed vulnerability scans and non-credentialed vulnerability scans are two different approaches to conducting vulnerability assessments. The choice between the two types of scans depends on the goals of the assessment, the level of access available, and the desired depth of vulnerability detection.

### Credentialed Scans

In a credentialed scan, the vulnerability scanning tool is provided with valid credentials (such as username and password) to access the target system or application. This allows the scanner to simulate an authenticated user's access, granting it deeper access to the system's files, configurations, and settings. Credentialed scans often provide more accurate and comprehensive results as they can uncover vulnerabilities that are only visible to authenticated users. They can identify missing patches, misconfigurations, and weaknesses that non-credentialed scans might miss. However, they require careful handling of credentials to ensure security.

### Non-Credentialed Scans

Non-credentialed scans, also known as unauthenticated scans, are conducted without providing specific credentials to the scanning tool. These scans rely on external observation, analyzing network traffic, and examining publicly available information. They focus on vulnerabilities that can be identified without logging into the system, such as open ports, outdated services, and known vulnerabilities that can be detected remotely. Non-credentialed scans are generally quicker and easier to perform but might not provide as comprehensive results compared to credentialed scans.

## Intrusive vs. Non-Intrusive Scans

Intrusive scans and non-intrusive scans represent different levels of interaction and impact during vulnerability scans.

### Instrusive Scans

Intrusive scans involve actively probing and interacting with the target system, network, or application. These scans may exploit vulnerabilities or weaknesses to gain a deeper understanding of potential risks. While they can provide more accurate results, intrusive scans carry a higher risk of causing disruptions or unintended consequences in the scanned environment. 

### Non-Intrusive Scans

Non-intrusive scans are performed without actively exploiting vulnerabilities or interacting extensively with the target. These scans focus on gathering information from publicly available data, analyzing network traffic, and examining configurations. They are less likely to cause disruptions but might not provide as detailed insights into potential vulnerabilities as intrusive scans do.

## Application Vulnerability Scans

Applications are software programs responsible for handling and processing data within an information system. Serving as the main bridge between users and data, they carry out important tasks, functions, or services for users or other software. Due to their central role, applications become prime targets for cyberattacks. Vulnerability scans evaluate the resilience of deployed applications when subjected to potential attacks. Application vulnerabilities present particularly significant risks within an enterprise, given the necessity of applications and the limited means to rectify data-related issues at higher levels of the technology stack. Vulnerability scans play a vital role in identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities and assessing the alignment between an application's performance and the security objectives of the system. By scrutinizing applications for coding errors, configuration weaknesses, and outdated components, vulnerability scans offer a proactive approach to safeguarding systems against potential exploits and unauthorized access attempts.

## Web Applications Vulnerability Scans

Web applications are software programs operating on web servers, accessed by users via internet browsers. This accessibility, however, renders web applications especially vulnerable to attacks. Web application vulnerability scans aim to assess the security posture of these applications. These scans systematically examine web applications for known vulnerabilities and weaknesses in their code, configurations, and interactions with users. The goal is to identify potential entry points for attackers and to uncover vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise the application or its associated systems. By conducting these scans, organizations can proactively address security issues, patch vulnerabilities, and strengthen their web applications against potential threats, helping to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of both the application and the data it processes.

## Network Vulnerability Scans

Networks play a pivotal role in digital computing by facilitating communication and data sharing between devices, enabling the seamless exchange of information across various systems. However, these interconnected systems also introduce potential security vulnerabilities. Network vulnerability scanning is a crucial process used to identify weaknesses within an organization's network's infrastructure. It involves systematically probing the network for known security flaws, misconfigurations, and potential entry points that malicious actors could exploit. Vulnerability scanning tools employ a combination of automated techniques and databases of known vulnerabilities to detect and report weaknesses. The resulting information serves as a foundation for more targeted scans. These subsequent scans can focus on individual systems with greater precision, employing credentials and potentially more intrusive techniques to identify vulnerabilities in a more detailed and sophisticated manner. This strategic approach to vulnerability scanning aids organizations in proactively addressing security risks and improving their network defenses.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) are vital tools in the realm of cybersecurity. CVE identifiers are standardized names for known vulnerabilities and security exposures in software and hardware products. These identifiers enable security practitioners and researchers to easily reference and communicate about specific vulnerabilities across different platforms. 

On the other hand, CVSS is a scoring system that quantifies the severity of vulnerabilities, providing a common framework for evaluating and prioritizing security risks. The CVSS score ranges from 0 to 10. As the CVSS score increases, so does the severity of risk from the vulnerability. CVSS scores take into account factors like exploitability, impact, and complexity to offer an objective measure of a vulnerability's potential risk level. This information is crucial for security professionals to make informed decisions about which vulnerabilities need immediate attention, enabling efficient allocation of resources for vulnerability management and remediation efforts.

## Configuration Review

Configuration review involves the thorough examination of an organization's IT systems and network configurations to ensure they adhere to security best practices and compliance standards. This process aims to identify misconfigurations, weak settings, and vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by attackers. Vulnerability scanning tools can play a crucial role in performing configuration reviews. By using these tools, organizations can automatically scan and assess the configurations of their systems, devices, and network components. The tools compare the identified configurations against established benchmarks and predefined security standards, highlighting deviations and potential risks. This enables organizations to swiftly pinpoint and rectify configuration weaknesses, bolstering their overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks.

The Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) and Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) guides are standardized frameworks that play a pivotal role in configuration review and security assessment. CCE provides a common language for describing system configurations, offering a consistent way to identify and categorize settings across various platforms. On the other hand, CPE defines a structured method for naming and describing hardware, software, and operating system components. Both guides facilitate effective configuration review by providing a shared vocabulary and structure, enabling security professionals to precisely identify and assess configurations against established best practices and benchmarks. 

## Conclusion

Vulnerability Scanning enables organizations to identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited, allowing for timely remediation and fortification of defenses. As technology evolves and threats become more sophisticated, vulnerability scanning stands as an indispensable tool in the arsenal of cybersecurity professionals, contributing to the resilience of digital infrastructures and the protection of sensitive information.
