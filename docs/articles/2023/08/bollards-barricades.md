# Bollards and Barricades in Physical Security

Bollards and barricades are some of the simplest, yet most effective physical security mechanisms in use today. Although they say seem basic compared to many technological solutions, bollards and barricades play a crucial role in protecting assets, infrastructure, and people from various threats, ranging from unauthorized vehicle access to terrorist attacks. These physical security measures are essential components of any comprehensive security strategy, and understanding their types, purposes, and deployment is valuable for any security professional.

 

## What are Bollards and Barricades

In case you haven’t met either of the terms, bollards and barricades are physical barriers designed to control or restrict vehicle and pedestrian access to specific areas. They are commonly employed in public spaces, government buildings, commercial properties, and critical infrastructure to mitigate the risks associated with vehicle-borne threats, accidental collisions, and unauthorized access. You also often see them in areas where traffic and people tend to mix, for example in car parks or street crossings. These barriers can vary in design, material, and functionality, depending on the security requirements and aesthetic considerations of the environment they are deployed in.



## Types of Bollards

Bollards come in a variety of types, each serving a unique purpose in security and access control:

- **Fixed Bollards:** These are permanently installed barriers that provide a high level of security against unauthorized vehicle access. They are often made of strong materials such as concrete, steel, or even specialized materials designed to withstand impact forces. Fixed bollards are commonly used in areas where perimeter protection is paramount, such as government buildings and sensitive infrastructure.

- **Removable Bollards:** These bollards offer flexibility in access control. They can be manually removed or lowered to allow authorized vehicles to pass through, but can quickly be reinstalled to secure the area again. Removable bollards are useful in areas where occasional vehicle access is required, such as loading zones or emergency vehicle entry points.

- **Retractable Bollards:** These bollards can be raised or lowered electronically, offering quick and convenient access control. They are commonly used in areas where frequent changes to access are necessary, such as parking facilities and commercial entrances.

  

## Types of Barricades

Barricades are another form of physical barrier used to control pedestrian and vehicle movement. They are usually temporary and can be quickly deployed as needed. Types include:

- **Jersey Barriers:** Also known as concrete barriers, these are heavy, movable barriers often used to channel traffic and protect against vehicle intrusions during events or construction projects. They can also serve as blast mitigation tools in high-security areas.

- **Water-Filled Barriers:** These barricades are made from plastic and can be easily filled with water to increase their weight and effectiveness. They are often used in traffic control situations, such as redirecting traffic away from hazardous areas or creating temporary roadblocks.

- **Cable Barriers:** These barriers are typically made from steel cables and are used to prevent vehicular intrusion while still allowing visibility. They are commonly seen in parking areas, pedestrian zones, and event venues.

  

## Factors to Consider in Deployment

Fitting bollards or barricades can be expensive – temporary deployments are often easy to facilitate and the required equipment (especially with water-filled barricades) can be hired and erected quickly and cheaply – however permeant installations, especially of retractable options can be costly. When deploying bollards and barricades, there are therefore several factors need to be taken into account:

- **Threat Assessment:** Understand the potential threats and risks specific to the location. This assessment will guide the choice of barrier type and placement. In some cases, other forms physical security, such as defensive landscaping with earthen banks or trees, may be more appropriate. 
- **Aesthetics:** Balance the security needs with the visual appeal of the environment. Bollards and barricades can be designed to blend into the surroundings without compromising their security capabilities, but this tends to add more cost. 
- **Accessibility:** Ensure that the barriers do not impede accessibility for authorized personnel and emergency responders. Access points should be clearly marked and easily operable.
- **Maintenance:** Regular maintenance is essential to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of the barriers. Mechanical and electronic components should be regularly inspected and serviced. This is especially the case for movable obstacles, which lose most of their value if a mechanical issue prevents them from functioning as desired. 
- **Safety enhancement:** Remember that bollards and barricades can also be used to enhance the safety of individuals who should have access to an area – for example, it’s common to see a fuel tank or other potentially dangerous object protected by bollards, primarily to prevent anyone from accidentally reversing into it! 

## Final Words

Bollards and barricades are essential components of a comprehensive physical security strategy. They provide a critical layer of protection against vehicle-borne threats, unauthorized access, and accidental collisions. By understanding the various types of bollards and barricades, their deployment considerations, and their roles in different environments, security professionals can effectively safeguard assets, infrastructure, and people from potential security breaches.
