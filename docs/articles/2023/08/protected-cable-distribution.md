# Protected Cable Distribution

If you’re familiar with the OSI model, you’ll know that the whole system depends upon a functional infrastructure at layer 1 – the physical layer. If the cables which connect nodes within your network are damaged and do not function…nothing will work! Protected cable distribution is the process of installing cabling in a way which aims to prevent damage or interference with cabling either through daily usage, interference or during maintenance. 

 

## The Components of Protected Cable Distribution

Effective PCD relies on several key components. One of the most important are the physical structures used to protect cabling – these are called Enclosures and Conduits. Secure enclosures and conduits used inside buildings are usually plastic trunking or tubing which physically shield the cables from tampering, environmental factors, and potential physical damage. When cable runs traverse outdoor environments (usually underground) concrete, plastic or metal piping can be used to protect them from accidental damage during maintenance works. You might be surprised to learn how often cables are damaged during roadworks or maintenance – network engineers sometimes call this “backhoe fade”! 

Cable Shielding is espeially critical in some environments – all copper cables are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference (EMI), so when a cable run must traverse an area of high EMI specialized cables equipped with shielding layers are utilised to help fend off the interference. These shields are made of conductive materials and usually take the form of sleeving wrapped around the data lines within the cable itself – they act as barriers that absorb and divert electromagnetic signals, preventing them from affecting the data within the cables, although they are not usually 100 per cent effective. In very high EMI environments, or where data loss or damage is totally unacceptable it may be more efficient to opt for fibre cabling, which (being a light-based medium) is immune to EMI. 

Grounding Systems are also important for protecting cabling. Grounding plays a vital role in dissipating unwanted electrical charges and static buildup. Proper grounding minimizes the risk of electrical surges and ensures a consistent electrical reference point across the network.

 

## Advantages of Protected Cable Distribution

Protected Cable Distribution offers numerous compelling advantages that enhance the reliability and security of data communication – these include:

- **Data Integrity**: By shielding cables from external interference, PCD ensures that data signals remain consistent and unaltered during transmission, reducing the risk of data corruption.

- **Security**: PCD measures provide an added layer of security against eavesdropping and unauthorized access. Even encrypted data can really only be considered as secure as the channels through which it travels, making PCD essential for maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive information.

- **Continuity**: Protected cables are less prone to damage from physical stress, environmental factors, and wear and tear. This robustness ensures continuous data flow, reducing downtime and associated operational disruptions.

-  **Cost Savings**: While implementing PCD can cost money up-front, there are long terms savings to be made as properly protected cabling often does not need to be replaced. 

  

## Implementing Protected Cable Distribution

Deploying PCD necessitates a comprehensive understanding of network requirements and potential physical threats as well as the technical know-how around the actual installation process. Factors such as cable types, environmental conditions, and the presence of electromagnetic interference should be carefully considered during implementation. Collaboration between IT professionals and security experts and installation technicians is usually required to ensure that  PCD solutions are properly tailored to the specific needs of the network.



## Mitigating Physical Threats

The benefits of Protected Cable Distribution also extend beyond electromagnetic interference – proper implementation can also provide a degree of protection against physical threats. Ultimately, it’s much harder to attempt to tap or interfere with a cable which is not easily accessible, while at the same time, many PCD solutions often integrate tamper-evident features, such as seals and intrusion detection systems. These mechanisms serve to deter attackers and can alert network administrators to any attempts at unauthorized access, enhancing the security of the network infrastructure.

 

## Compliance and Regulations

Industries with stringent compliance requirements, such as healthcare (HIPAA) and finance (PCI DSS), often also specifically demand secure data communication. PCD helps organizations meet these standards by providing a robust foundation for protecting sensitive information and maintaining compliance.

## Final Words

Protected Cable Distribution stands as a vital strategy in fortifying data communication against potential disruptions and security breaches. By shielding cables from physical and electromagnetic interference, PCD safeguards data integrity, confidentiality, and continuity. This protective approach finds relevance across industries where secure information exchange is paramount. As technology evolves and the importance of secure data transmission grows, PCD remains an essential tool in maintaining the reliability and security of networks worldwide.
