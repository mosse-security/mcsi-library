# Fire Suppression in IT Environments

In any business, fire is one of the most significant physical risks which needs to be contended with – fire represents not only a significant danger to life but also has a tendency to cause massive destruction. What’s worse, many fire extinguishing agents are extremely harmful to electronic equipment, leading to a situation where the response to a fire may even cause more damage than the fire itself. ) The loss of data, equipment, and operational downtime resulting from a fire can have dire consequences for businesses – some never recover. Fire suppression systems, specifically designed to combat fires in IT environments, play a pivotal role in minimizing these risks, ensuring data safety, and maintaining business continuity.

 

## Fires in IT environments – common causes

Before we take an in-depth look at fire suppression, let’s first consider some of the ways in which a fire can take hold in an IT-based environment. Of course, any building could be a victim of a natural disaster, or be caught up in a fire which started elsewhere, however, there are some risk vectors which are especially relevant in, for example, the data centre. 

- **Electrical Equipment Overheating -** In a data centre, the multitude of electrical equipment such as servers, switches, and power distribution units generates substantial heat. If proper cooling mechanisms fail, or if equipment is improperly maintained, there's a risk of overheating. This could lead to a fire if the surrounding environment becomes too hot, causing cables, insulation, or even equipment to catch fire. Regular monitoring of temperature, humidity, and proper ventilation is crucial to prevent such incidents.
- **Electrical Short Circuit -** Electrical short circuits occur when there's an unintended connection between conductors that should not be in contact. This can generate sparks, intense heat, and potentially ignite flammable materials nearby. Data centres with intricate wiring systems are susceptible to short circuits, particularly if there's poor installation or damaged wiring. Implementing proper cable management, routine inspections, and using fire-resistant materials can mitigate the risks.
- **UPS or Battery Malfunction -** Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) and backup batteries are essential components in data centres to provide power during outages. However, if these systems malfunction or are improperly maintained, they can pose a fire hazard. Overcharging or faulty connections in batteries can lead to overheating and potential fires. Regular testing, maintenance, and using high-quality equipment are vital to prevent such incidents.
- **Dust Accumulation -** Dust is an often underestimated risk in data centres. Accumulated dust can restrict airflow and increase the risk of overheating. In some cases, dust can also be conductive, leading to short circuits. Regular cleaning and maintenance, along with appropriate filtration systems, can help reduce these risks.
- **Human Error -** Mistakes made during equipment installation, maintenance, or repairs can lead to fires. For example, if a technician improperly handles electrical components, fails to secure connections, or uses incorrect wiring, it can result in sparks or overheating. Thorough training, clear procedures, and diligent supervision can minimize human error-related fire risks.
- **External Factors -** External factors like construction work near the data centre, accidental chemical spills, or nearby fires can also pose a threat. Smoke, fumes, and other environmental factors can affect the operation of the data centre and potentially lead to fire-related incidents.

 

## Understanding Fire Suppression Systems

Fire suppression systems are sophisticated setups designed to detect and extinguish fires rapidly, preventing their spread and minimizing potential damage. In IT environments, where sensitive equipment and data are housed, the deployment of specialized fire suppression solutions is essential to avoid collateral damage resulting from the fire suppression system itself. Unlike traditional water-based systems, which can cause additional damage to electrical equipment and data, these systems employ alternative agents that are non-conductive and safe for IT infrastructure.

 

## Detection and Activation

Fire suppression systems are typically equipped with advanced detection mechanisms that swiftly identify the presence of a fire. These mechanisms are usually one of either:

**Smoke Detectors**

Smoke detectors are sensitive to the presence of smoke particles in the air. When smoke is detected, the system initiates the suppression process. These detectors come in two major variations - ionization and photoelectric (more detail on this in a moment) 

**Heat Detectors**

Heat detectors monitor temperature changes in the environment. These devices come in two varieties. Fixed-temperature or fixed-point devices activate if the temperature in the area ever exceeds some predefined level. Rate-of-rise or rate-of-increase temperature devices activate when there is a sudden increase in local temperature that may indicate the beginning stages of a fire. Rate-of-rise sensors can provide an earlier warning but are also responsible for more false warnings.

Once a detector has been activated, some kind of suppressant material is deployed to help extinguish the fire. There are a number of common options for this which security professionals should be familiar with. 

 

## Smoke detectors – How do they work? 

Although there are many fire detection options, smoke detectors are by far the most widely used. These detectors come in two major variations - ionization and photoelectric.

The photoelectric smoke detector excels at providing early warnings for smouldering fires - this device continually monitors an internal beam of light, if any element that obstructs or distorts the light is detected (such as smoke) the alarm sounds.

By contrast, the ionization smoke detector works by using the principle of radiation. An ionization style of detector uses an ionization chamber and a small radioactive source to detect fast-burning fires. The chamber consists of two plates - one with a positive charge and one with a negative charge. Within the chamber, Oxygen and nitrogen particles in the air become “ionized” (an ion is freed from the molecule). The freed ion, which has a negative charge, is attracted to the positive plate, and the remaining part of the molecule, now with a positive charge, is attracted to the negative plate. This movement of particles creates a very small electric current that the device measures. The presence of smoke interferes with this process - the detector will detect the resulting drop in current and sound an alarm.

 

## Water-Based Fire Suppression Systems

Water-based fire suppression systems have historically served as the primary line of defence against structural fires. Even in the current technological landscape, where IT equipment is prevalent in office environments, water-based systems remain one of the most widely used fire safety strategies. While systems better suited for environments with electronic equipment exist, water-based suppression systems are some of the most affordable and simplest – hence they’re often still preferred. However, given the inherent vulnerability of electronic equipment to extensive water exposure, particularly due to the potential damage it can cause, understanding how to handle equipment in the aftermath of water-based sprinkler system activation becomes crucial.

 

### Water and IT Equipment - Mitigating Damage

Since water remains an effective and popular choice for fire suppression, guidelines on mitigating the issues of its use in the context of electronic systems have been developed. The National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) 2017 Standard for the Protection of Information Technology Equipment (NFPA 75) offers comprehensive guidelines for minimizing damage to electronic equipment exposed to water-based suppression systems. 

NFPA 75 outlines essential measures to protect information technology equipment in the event of water-based suppression system activation. These guidelines acknowledge the necessity of extinguishing fires promptly while also recognizing the unique vulnerabilities of electronic devices.

By following the recommendations in NFPA 75, businesses can substantially reduce the potential adverse impacts of water exposure – some key considerations include -

- **Proper Equipment Placement -** NFPA 75 recommends positioning critical IT equipment above the potential reach of sprinklers. Elevating equipment or installing protective barriers helps prevent direct water contact.
- **Enclosures and Sealing -** Employing sealed enclosures for IT equipment can provide an additional layer of protection against water intrusion. Properly designed enclosures can safeguard equipment even if water is present in the environment.
- **Backup Measures -** Implementing backup systems and data redundancy ensures that even if the equipment is compromised, essential data remains accessible. Regular backups safeguard against potential data loss.
- **Emergency Power-Off -** Equipping IT equipment with emergency power-off features allows for rapid shutdown in the event of a fire emergency. This prevents potential electrical hazards due to water exposure.
- **Drying and Cleaning Protocols -** In cases where water exposure occurs, following recommended drying and cleaning procedures specified by equipment manufacturers can mitigate damage and aid in rapid restoration.

It’s important to stress that the aim of these guidelines is to reduce the issues associated with water-based fire suppression – in a modern computing environment it’s still far from ideal. 

 

## **Clean-Agent Fire Suppression Systems**

Much better suited for computing environments are so-called “clean agent” suppression systems. These types of systems work by interfering at a chemical level with the combustion process, rather than dispensing material (such as water or foam) which can damage equipment. 

In fact, clean agent systems aren’t a new concept - for decades, carbon dioxide (CO2) has been used as a fire suppression agent, with its origins tracing back to the early 20th century when Bell Telephone Company started to deploy portable CO2 extinguishers. 

The efficacy of CO2 lies in its ability to tackle all three fundamental components essential for combustion - by displacing oxygen, CO2 creates an environment where the remaining oxygen is inadequate to sustain a fire. This agent's fire-fighting effect is augmented by its cooling effect in the fire zone and its role in diminishing the concentration of volatile fuels which are necessary to sustain fire.

Another valuable clean-agent fire suppression option is argon. This noble gas operates by a different mechanism, lowering the oxygen concentration to a level below the critical 15 percent threshold required for flammable materials to ignite. Designed to decrease oxygen content to approximately 12.5 percent, argon systems achieve a state where fire becomes untenable, while still preserving a safety margin above the 10 percent level mandated by the EPA for human well-being.

In the realm of advanced fire suppression solutions, Inergen, developed by Ansul Corporation, is a hybrid composition of gases - 52 percent nitrogen, 40 percent argon, and 8 percent carbon dioxide. Functioning akin to pure argon systems, Inergen systems target an oxygen level of around 12.5 percent. This level not only ensures human safety but also thwarts the fire's ability to thrive.

### **Benefits of Clean-Agent Fire Suppression Systems**

Especially in an IT environment, clean agent systems have some significant advantages, which include: 

1. **Rapid Fire Suppression -** Clean agents, including CO2, argon, and Inergen, act swiftly to suppress fires, minimizing potential damage and allowing for quicker recovery.
2. **Non-Destructive -** Unlike water-based systems, clean agents leave no residue, minimizing damage to sensitive IT equipment and data.
3. **Safe for Human Occupancy -** Clean agents are designed to maintain a breathable atmosphere for occupants while effectively extinguishing fires, although evacuation should still be initiated as soon as possible.
4. **Electrical Equipment Compatibility -** These agents are non-conductive, making them safe for use in environments with electrical equipment.
5. **No Post-Suppression Clean-up -** The absence of residue means there is no need for time-consuming post-suppression clean-up, resulting in less downtime.

 

## Handheld extinguishers

Although computer security professionals typically do not have much influence over the type of fire suppression system that their office has fitted they may well be able to influence the type of handheld fire extinguishers which are located throughout the building. It’s therefore well worth understanding the types since properly handling a small fire can both prevent a disaster and minimise damage, whereas mishandling it can lead to more destruction than necessary and even loss of life.

In order to aid understanding, fires are broken up into classes. Fire classes categorize fires based on the type of fuel involved, helping to determine the most effective firefighting approach. Each class corresponds to a specific type of extinguishing agent that is best suited to combat fires of that class. Here's a breakdown of the fire classes -

- **Class A -** These fires involve common combustible materials like wood, paper, cloth, trash, and plastics. Water and foam extinguishers are typically used to cool and smother the fire by removing heat and preventing the fire's oxygen supply.
- **Class B -** Flammable liquids and gases, such as gasoline, oil, and propane, characterize these fires. Foam, dry chemical, and carbon dioxide extinguishers are employed to interrupt the fire's chemical reaction and suffocate it.
- **Class C -** Electrical fires are under this category. They involve live electrical equipment. Non-conductive extinguishing agents like carbon dioxide and dry chemical are used to avoid electrical shock while suppressing the fire.
- **Class D -** Combustible metals, including magnesium and sodium, cause these fires. Specific dry powder extinguishing agents, designed to counteract the unique properties of these metals, are used to smother the fire and interrupt chemical reactions.
- **Class K -** Fires fueled by cooking oils and fats in commercial kitchens fall into this class. Wet chemical extinguishers react with the oils, creating a soap-like substance that smothers the fire and cools the surface.
- **Class F -** Some regions recognize a Class F for fires involving cooking fats and oils, which is similar to Class K. The extinguishing agents, however, may differ.

Here's a summary table for quick reference -

| **Fire Class** | **Fuel Type**                           | **Common Extinguishing Agents**         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| A              | Combustible solids                      | Water, Foam                             |
| B              | Flammable liquids and gases             | Foam, Dry Chemical, Carbon Dioxide      |
| C              | Electrical fires                        | Carbon Dioxide, Dry Chemical            |
| D              | Combustible metals                      | Specific Dry Powder                     |
| K              | Cooking oils and fats                   | Wet Chemical                            |
| F              | Cooking fats and oils (in some regions) | Extinguishing agents similar to Class K |

 

Based on the class of fire, location of use, safety factor for humans and the proximity to technology, it’s possible to obtain the best possible extinguishers for an area. The common types of extinguishers and the other key information are shown in the table below.

 

| **Fire Extinguisher Type** | **Class of Fire** | **Common Extinguishing Agents** | **Suitable for Human Safety** | **Suitability for Technology** |
| :------------------------- | :---------------- | :------------------------------ | :---------------------------: | :----------------------------- |
| Water                      | Class A           | Water                           |              Yes              | No                             |

| Water Mist                 | Class A, C        | Water Mist                      |              Yes              | Yes                            |

 

Maintaining fire extinguishers is also paramount to ensure their reliability when they’re needed. Regular inspections, typically monthly, involve checking for visible damage, proper pressure levels, and accessibility. Additionally, annual professional inspections ensure that internal components are functioning as intended. Maintenance extends to ensuring that extinguishers are easily accessible, unobstructed, and equipped with readable labels and instructions. Proper storage and protection against extreme temperatures are also crucial to their longevity. 

Handheld fire extinguishers generally remain effective for 5 to 15 years, contingent on the type and manufacturer. However, this effectiveness hinges on proper maintenance. Regular inspections, timely refills or replacements, and adherence to manufacturer guidelines are essential to guaranteeing an extinguisher's readiness to combat fires effectively.
