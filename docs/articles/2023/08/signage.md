# Signage 

In the realm of physical security, signage serves as a vital communication tool that guides, informs, and deters. Well-designed and strategically placed signage can play a crucial role in preventing security breaches, managing crowd behaviour, and ensuring the safety of individuals and assets. This article explores the significance of signage in physical security, the types of security-related signage, best practices for signage deployment, and the benefits they offer.



## The Importance of Signage in Physical Security

Signage is something which we tend to take for granted as users, however from a design and implementation perspective it can actually be quite complex! Signage is often referred to as a "visual language" – fundamentally, its objective is to effectively convey important messages to individuals within a space. Often, signage may need to communicate information to individuals who do not even speak the native language so a great deal of thought and testing does often go into its production! 

*Tip: If you need an example of excellent "visual language" think of the signage you see at an airport - this is an environment in which security and organisation are paramount, but also one in which the majority of users may well not speak a common language.* 

In the context of physical security, signage serves several key purposes:

- **Deterrence:** Signage can deter potential wrongdoers by clearly indicating the presence of security measures, such as surveillance cameras, alarms, or access control systems.

- **Guidance:** Well-placed signage helps guide individuals through spaces, preventing accidental unauthorized access to restricted areas and ensuring compliance with security protocols.

- **Emergency Preparedness:** Signage provides critical information on evacuation routes, assembly points, and emergency exits, enabling swift and orderly responses during crisis situations.

- **Regulation:** Security-related signage communicates rules and regulations, such as restricted access zones, ID badge requirements, and prohibited activities.

- **Recognition:** While most signage takes the form of, well, signs! – the topic of signage can also take into account items like ID badges or lanyards, which might give a visual clue as to the wearers level of clearance etc. 

  

## Types of Security-Related Signage:

Some common types of signage to be familiar with from a security perspective could include: 

- **Access Control Signs:** These signs communicate who is allowed in specific areas, guiding individuals to present identification, swipe cards, or adhere to other access control measures.

- **Surveillance Signs:** Signs indicating the presence of surveillance cameras act as deterrents and remind individuals that their actions are being monitored. In some countries, this is a legal requirement when operating CCTV systems. 

- **Restricted Area Signs:** These signs clearly mark areas where access is limited to authorized personnel only, deterring unauthorized entry.

- **Danger Area Signs:** Signs can also alert users to areas which are sometimes, or always a hazardous environment – this might be the case if machinery such as a forklift truck might operate in an area, or if an area can experience a very high volume level which could pose a risk to hearing. 

- **Emergency Exit Signs:** Essential for safety, these signs indicate the locations of emergency exits, escape routes, and assembly points during evacuations.

- **Fire Safety Signs:** Fire safety signage includes fire extinguisher locations, fire alarm pull stations, and instructions for using emergency fire equipment.

- **Warning Signs:** Warning signs alert individuals to other conditions they might need to be aware of, such as areas under construction or temporary issues such as a wet floor.

  

## Best Practices for Signage Deployment:

While designing signage is not usually within the prevue of an IT security professional, risk managers may need to review its usage and effectiveness periodically. Some best practice items to consider include: 

- **Clarity and Legibility:** Signage should be clear and easy to read, using simple language and concise messages to ensure quick comprehension.

- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent design and colour scheme across all security-related signage to establish a recognizable visual identity.

- **Strategic Placement:** Position signage where it's most relevant and visible, ensuring that individuals encounter the information when and where they need it.

- **Size and Visibility:** Choose appropriate sign sizes based on the viewing distance. Signs should be visible from a reasonable distance to avoid confusion.

- **Multilingual Signage:** In diverse environments, consider using multilingual signage to ensure that messages are understood by all occupants. If this is not appropriate, ensure that signage could be understood from visual cues alone (ie without being able to read the language) wherever possible. 

- **Regular Maintenance:** Periodically inspect signage to ensure it remains in good condition. Worn-out or damaged signs should be replaced promptly.

  

## Benefits of Effective Signage:

Finally, let's consider some of the benefits of effective, well-designed signage. These can be:

1. **Improved Awareness:** Well-designed signage raises awareness about security measures and protocols, reducing the likelihood of accidental breaches.
2. **Reduced Liability:** Clear warning signs in hazardous areas help mitigate the risk of accidents and injuries, reducing potential legal liabilities. In some jurisdictions failing to implement proper signage can be an offence and at the very least may give grounds for a lawsuit. 
3. **Enhanced Emergency Response:** Emergency-related signage facilitates faster and safer evacuations by providing clear directions during critical situations.
4. **Behavioural Influence:** Signage can influence behaviour by guiding individuals to follow established security procedures and adhere to access restrictions.
5. **Cost Savings:** Effective signage can lead to cost savings by preventing security breaches, minimizing accidents, and streamlining emergency responses.

 

## Final Words

Signage is an important but often overlooked component of physical security, serving as a silent but valuable tool that communicates essential information, deters potential threats, and guides individuals toward safe and acceptable patterns of behaviour. By strategically deploying well-designed and clear signage, an organisation can create a safer and more secure environment while promoting compliance with security protocols and enhancing overall awareness of security measures.
