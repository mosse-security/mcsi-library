# WI-FI protected access

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is a security protocol designed to improve the security of wireless networks. It was developed as an upgrade to the previous Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol, which had several serious security vulnerabilities. WPA provides a stronger level of encryption and authentication to protect wireless communications from eavesdropping, unauthorized access, and data manipulation. 

The cryptographic standards used in WPA are essential for ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of Wi-Fi communications.

## The Need for WPA

The need for WPA arises from the vulnerabilities of WEP, which was the initial security protocol for Wi-Fi networks. WEP used a static encryption key, which made it susceptible to various attacks, such as key cracking and replay attacks. As a result, it became relatively easy for attackers to gain unauthorized access to WEP-protected networks and compromise sensitive data.

To address these security flaws and strengthen wireless network security, the Wi-Fi Alliance introduced WPA as an interim security solution in 2003. Later, WPA2 was introduced, which provided an even stronger security framework. WPA and WPA2 have since become the standard security protocols for Wi-Fi networks, with WPA3 being the latest and most secure version.

## Cryptographic Standards in WPA

WPA uses cryptographic standards to protect wireless communications. The core elements of WPA's cryptographic standards include:

**1.	Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP):** TKIP is the encryption algorithm used in WPA to encrypt data transmitted over the wireless network. It dynamically generates encryption keys for each data packet, making it more secure than WEP's static encryption keys. TKIP was designed as a temporary solution until more robust encryption methods could be developed.

**2.	Message Integrity Check (MIC):** MIC is a mechanism used in WPA to ensure the integrity of data packets. It adds a cryptographic hash value to each packet, allowing the recipient to verify that the packet hasn't been altered during transmission.

**3.	Pre-Shared Key (PSK) or 802.1X/EAP:** WPA supports two methods for user authentication. In PSK mode, a pre-shared key (i.e., a password) is used for authentication. In 802.1X/EAP mode, a more robust authentication method based on Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is employed, often in conjunction with a RADIUS server for centralized authentication.

**4.	Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP):** WPA2 introduced CCMP, a more advanced encryption algorithm based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). CCMP replaced TKIP as the default encryption method in WPA2, providing stronger encryption and data integrity.

## WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3) 

WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3) is the latest and more secure version of the Wi-Fi security protocol, designed to enhance wireless network security and provide better protection against various cyber threats. 

Some of the main features of WPA3 are as follows:

**1.	Enhanced Protection Against Brute-Force Attacks:** WPA3 introduces the use of Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), also known as Dragonfly, for key exchange during the initial authentication process. SAE is resistant to offline dictionary attacks and provides stronger protection against brute-force attacks on the Wi-Fi password.

**2.	Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE):** WPA3 introduces Opportunistic Wireless Encryption, which provides a more secure connection for open Wi-Fi networks. Even without requiring a pre-shared key or password, OWE encrypts data between the client and the access point, mitigating the risk of eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks on open networks.

**3.	192-bit Security Suite (WPA3-Enterprise):** WPA3 introduces a stronger cryptographic security suite based on 192-bit encryption for WPA3-Enterprise networks. This provides better protection for organizations and enterprises, particularly those handling sensitive data.

**4.	Protection Against Downgrade Attacks:** WPA3 includes protections to prevent devices from falling back to the less secure WPA2 if WPA3 is not available. This reduces the risk of attackers exploiting devices that may not support WPA3.

**5.	Individualized Data Encryption (WPA3-Personal):** WPA3-Personal uses unique data encryption for each device connected to the network, providing additional protection for devices against potential attacks on group keys.

**6.	Improved Public Wi-Fi Security:** WPA3 enhances security for public Wi-Fi networks, reducing the risks associated with connecting to open and unsecured networks commonly found in public places.

**7.	Easy Device Provisioning:** WPA3 simplifies the process of adding new devices to the network with improved device provisioning methods, making it easier for users to securely connect new devices to their Wi-Fi network.

**8.	Security Enhancements for IoT Devices:** WPA3 provides additional security features tailored for IoT (Internet of Things) devices, protecting these devices from potential security vulnerabilities.

## Closing Words

It's important to note that WPA3 is not backward compatible with older devices that support only WPA2 or WPA1. However, as WPA3 becomes more widely adopted, newer devices will likely include support for WPA3, improving overall network security.
