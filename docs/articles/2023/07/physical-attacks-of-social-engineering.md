# Physical attacks in social engineering

Physical attacks in social engineering refer to tactics where an attacker manipulates individuals in person, leveraging human psychology and exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to physical spaces or assets. These attacks often involve direct interaction and manipulation of individuals to bypass physical security measures. Here are a few common physical attack techniques used in social engineering:

## 1.	Tailgating/Piggybacking

In this attack, an attacker follows closely behind an authorized person to gain entry to a secure area. They rely on the natural tendency of individuals to hold doors open for others or hesitate to confront strangers. By exploiting politeness or trust, the attacker gains access to restricted spaces.

## 2.	Impersonation

Impersonation involves posing as an authorized person or a representative of a trusted organization. To deceive individuals, the attacker may dress like a maintenance worker, delivery person, or other personnel. By leveraging uniforms, badges, or forged credentials, they gain trust and access to sensitive areas.

## 3.	Dumpster Diving

Dumpster diving is a technique where an attacker searches through trash or recycling bins to gather valuable information. They look for discarded documents, receipts, or other materials that contain sensitive data, such as passwords, access codes, or account details. This information can be used for further attacks or to gain unauthorized entry.

## 4.	Eavesdropping 

Eavesdropping involves the unauthorized interception of conversations or information in public spaces. Attackers may listen to conversations or gather sensitive data by observing and overhearing interactions. By capturing information about security protocols, access codes, or employee routines, they can exploit vulnerabilities in the physical security system.

## 5.	Physical manipulation

Attackers may use physical manipulation techniques to bypass or turn off security measures. This can include tampering with locks, disabling alarms, or bypassing access controls. By exploiting vulnerabilities in the physical infrastructure, they gain unauthorized access to restricted areas.

## 6.	Social pressure and distraction
Attackers may use social pressure or distractions to manipulate individuals into compliance. This can involve creating a sense of urgency, posing as an authority figure, or causing a commotion to divert attention. These tactics exploit people's natural responses to social cues, making it easier for the attacker to gain access or distract security personnel.

To mitigate physical attacks in social engineering, raising awareness, training on physical security protocols, and implementing robust security measures are neccessary. This includes promoting a culture of vigilance, encouraging employees to report suspicious activities, and regularly updating security protocols to address emerging threats. Physical security measures such as access control systems, video surveillance, and employee identification can help deter and detect physical attacks.
