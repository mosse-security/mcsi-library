# Cryptographic Attacks

In the world of information security, a cryptographic system plays a vital role in protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access. It uses complex algorithms and protocols to change plaintext into ciphertext (and vice versa) during the process of encryption and decryption. By doing so, it ensures that the sensitive data remains safe while upholding security principles like confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. However, despite their strong design, cryptographic systems can still face potential threats, as attackers continuously look for weaknesses to exploit. In this article, we will explore cryptographic attacks and their various types.

## What is a Cryptographic Attack?

A cryptographic attack is a type of attack that targets a cryptographic system with the intent of uncovering the original message from the encrypted data by compromising its security. These attacks rely on exploiting two primary weaknesses. Firstly, some individuals perceive cryptography as overly complex and incomprehensible, leading them to place blind trust in its effectiveness without sound reasons. Secondly, while computer experts may understand the algorithms used, they may occasionally overlook vulnerabilities in the system that can be exploited by attackers.

## Types of Cryptographic Attacks

In this section, we will explore various types of cryptographic attacks, examining the distinctive methods and techniques employed by adversaries to compromise the security of cryptographic systems.

## Birthday Attack

A birthday attack is a brute force attack that finds hash collisions by utilizing the birthday paradox. In order to understand how the birthday attack takes place, let us first understand the mechanism of a hash function and the birthday problem.

### The Mechanism of a Hashing Function

A hashing function is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input (or "message") of any size and produces a fixed-size output, known as the hash value. Hashing functions provide data integrity by creating a unique and fixed-size hash value for a given input data. When data is hashed, the resulting hash value is like a digital fingerprint that uniquely identifies the original data. Any slight modification to the input data should result in a completely different hash value. Strong cryptographic hash functions should have the following characteristics:

* The hash should be a one-way function which means that it should be impossible to convert hash values back to plaintext.

* The hash function should not provide the same hash value for two or more different messages.

### The Birthday Problem

The birthday problem is a mathematical concept in statistics that deals with the likelihood of shared birthdays in a group of people. Imagine people walking into a room one by one. How many people must be in the same room for the chance to be greater than 50% that another person has the same birthday as you? The answer is 253 people! However, for a 50% chance that at least two people share the same birthday, you only need 23 people. In the first instance, you are looking for someone with a specific birthday date that matches yours. In the second instance, you are looking for any two people who share the same birthday. There is a higher probability of finding two people who share a birthday than of finding another person who shares your birthday. Or, stated another way, it is easier to find two matching values in a sea of values than to find a match for just one specific value.

### How does the Birthday Attack work?

As stated earlier, a strong hashing algorithm does not produce the same hash value for two different messages. If the algorithm does produce the same value for two distinctly different messages, this is called a collision. An attacker can attempt to force a collision, which is in turn referred to as a birthday attack. 

Suppose a hashing algorithm produces a hash value equal to n bits and it can output 2<sup>n</sup> different hash values. To find a message through a brute-force attack that results in a specific hash value would require hashing 2<sup>n</sup> random messages. To take this one step further, finding two messages that hash to the same value would require review of only 2<sup>n/2</sup> messages. Therefore, if a hashing algorithm generates a message digest of n bits, there is a high likelihood that an adversary can find a collision using only 2<sup>n/2</sup> inputs.

In the context of password hashes, the birthday attack becomes relevant when trying to crack hashed passwords. Instead of brute-forcing each possible password, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, attackers can use the birthday attack to exploit collisions. The goal of the attacker is not to find a specific password but any password that maps to the hash thatâ€™s stored on the server. If another string maps to the same hash output as a legitimate password, it would be authenticated by the server. Modern computers, equipped with high processing power and ample storage have the capability to generate a large number of hash values and search for collisions more easily.

## Collision Attack

A collision attack is closely related to a birthday attack. A collision attack occurs when an attacker finds two different inputs that produce the same output when passed through a hash function. The attacker achieves this by subtly manipulating the data, creating multiple versions of a digital file that appear unchanged to the user but have different contents. By utilizing the birthday attack technique to search for collisions among the numerous versions, the attacker can ultimately create a file with modified visible content but identical hash values. This manipulation allows the attacker to deceive systems relying on the uniqueness of hash values, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities and forged data.

### How does a Collision Attack work?

Suppose a digital signature algorithm uses a hash function to create a hash of the message and then signs the hash with a private key to generate the digital signature. By exploiting vulnerabilities in the hash function's collision resistance, the attacker searches for two different messages with the same hash value. Once found, the attacker can present one message to a legitimate party for signing, but later substitute it with the second colliding message, fooling the recipient into accepting the forged digital signature as valid for both messages. This manipulation allows the attacker to deceive the verification process, undermining the integrity and trustworthiness of digital signatures.

## Downgrade Attack

A downgrade attack is a type of cyber attack in which an adversary exploits weaknesses in a communication channel to force it to use weaker cryptographic protocols or algorithms. The goal of the attacker is to downgrade the security of the communication to a vulnerable level, making it easier to intercept or manipulate sensitive information.

### How does a Downgrade Attack work?

Suppose a web browser supports the latest and most secure version of TLS(transport layer security) encryption protocol, which provides greater security for communication between the browser and the server. The web server is also configured to use the latest version of TLS as the preferred encryption protocol.

However, an attacker positioned between the web browser and the server intercepts the initial communication handshake between the two parties.

During the handshake process, the browser and server exchange information about their supported encryption protocols. The attacker manipulates this communication and removes support for the latest version of TLS.

As a result, when the browser and server attempt to negotiate the encryption protocol, they find that the latest version of TLS is no longer supported. If backward compatibility is supported, the communication channel downgrades to use an older and less secure version of this protocol.

This gives the attacker an opportunity to exploit the weaker security of the downgraded communication channel. He/She can now potentially intercept sensitive information, decrypt encrypted data, or even inject malicious content into the communication stream.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, cryptographic attacks pose significant threats to the security of digital information. With the advancement in technology and techniques used by malicious adversaries, it is crucial for individuals and organizations to adopt robust encryption methods and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in cryptography.
