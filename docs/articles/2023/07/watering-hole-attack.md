# Watering Hole Attack

A watering hole attack is a passive technique where the threat actor does not communicate directly with its target. The technique is named after the behaviour of predators, such as lions, who lie in wait near watering holes to ambush their prey. Watering hole attacks are often used as a more focused and stealthy approach compared to other widespread malware distribution methods like mass phishing emails. The attackers rely on the trustworthiness of the compromised websites and the likelihood that their intended victims will visit those sites regularly.

In a watering hole attack, the attackers identify websites that are frequently visited by their target audience, such as employees of a particular company, members of a specific industry, or a particular group of individuals with shared interests. The attackers then compromise one or more of these websites and inject malicious code or malware into the site's content.

When a member of the targeted group visits the compromised website, the malicious code is executed on their system, infecting their device with malware. This malware can then be used to gain unauthorized access to the victim's system, steal sensitive information, or conduct further attacks.
The stages involved in a typical watering hole attack are:

**1.	Identification of the target:** The attackers identify their intended victims or target audience, determining which websites they are likely to visit regularly.

**2.	Compromise the website:** The attackers then compromise one or more of these websites by exploiting vulnerabilities or using other hacking techniques to gain unauthorized access.

**3.	Insertion of the malicious payload:** Once inside the compromised website, the attackers inject malicious code into the website's content, which is delivered to visitors' browsers when they access the site.

**4.	Infection of the victim:** When members of the target group visit the compromised website, the malicious code is executed on their devices, infecting them with malware.

**5.	Data Exfiltration or Further Attacks:** The malware installed on the victim's system may be used to steal sensitive information, gain unauthorized access to networks, or launch other types of attacks, depending on the attackers' objectives.

## Conclusion 

To defend against watering hole attacks, organizations and individuals should take several measures, including keeping software and systems up to date with the latest security patches, using reputable security software, educating users about the risks of visiting unfamiliar websites, and monitoring for signs of malicious activity on their networks.
