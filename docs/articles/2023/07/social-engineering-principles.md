# Social engineering principles

Social engineering is a method used to manipulate and deceive individuals to gain unauthorized access to information or resources. It exploits human trust and relies on psychological and interpersonal techniques rather than technical means.
Social engineering attacks rely on one or more of the following principles:

## Familiarity/Liking

The social engineering principle of familiarity and liking is based on the notion that people are more inclined to trust and comply with individuals they are familiar with or have positive feelings towards. This principle leverages the psychological tendency to prefer and be influenced by people we know, like, or share commonalities with.

Here's how the principle of familiarity and liking can be used in social engineering:

- Building rapport: Social engineers aim to establish a connection and build rapport with their targets. They may research personal information about their targets in advance, such as hobbies, interests, or backgrounds, to create a sense of familiarity during interactions. By appearing knowledgeable or having shared experiences, they can build trust and increase the likelihood of compliance.
- Exploiting relationships: Social engineers may exploit existing relationships or common connections to gain trust and credibility. By claiming to be recommended by a mutual acquaintance or belonging to the same social or professional network, they can tap into the trust associated with those relationships and make their requests appear more legitimate.
- Mimicking behaviour: Social engineers may mirror the behaviour, mannerisms, or communication style of their targets. This mirroring technique helps create a subconscious sense of familiarity and comfort, leading the target to perceive the social engineer as someone they can relate to and trust.
- Appealing to shared interests or values: Social engineers often try to identify and emphasize shared interests, values, or goals with their targets. By highlighting commonalities, they create a sense of connection and affinity, making the target more inclined to comply with their requests.
- Flattery and compliments: Social engineers may employ flattery and compliments to establish a positive emotional connection with their targets. By making individuals feel good about themselves, they can create a favourable impression and increase the likelihood of compliance.

It's crucial to be aware of the social engineering principle of familiarity and liking to protect yourself from manipulation. Maintain a healthy level of scepticism, even when interacting with individuals who appear familiar or likable. Be cautious of individuals who quickly establish a personal connection or seem overly friendly, especially if they start making unusual requests or seeking sensitive information. Verify information independently and rely on established channels of communication to confirm the legitimacy of requests.

## Consensus/Social Proof

The social engineering principle of consensus, also known as social proof, is based on the idea that people tend to follow the actions and behaviours of others in uncertain or unfamiliar situations. This principle exploits the natural human tendency to conform to social norms and seek validation from others.

Here's how the principle of consensus/social proof can be leveraged in social engineering:

- Creating a perception of popularity: Social engineers may try to create the illusion that a particular course of action or belief is widely accepted or endorsed by many others. They might use techniques like fake testimonials, fabricated social media engagement, or false reviews to make their claims appear more credible.
- Influencing through social networks: Social engineers may target individuals who are well-connected or influential within a particular social group or organization. By convincing these key individuals to adopt a certain behaviour or belief, they can influence a larger network of people who trust and follow their lead.
- Exploiting the fear of missing out: Social engineers may use tactics to make individuals believe that they are missing out on something valuable or beneficial if they don't comply with their requests. By presenting an opportunity as scarce or exclusive, they can manipulate people into taking action without thoroughly evaluating the situation.
- Leveraging groupthink: Groupthink occurs when individuals prioritize conformity and consensus over critical thinking and independent judgment. Social engineers may exploit this tendency by creating a false sense of consensus among a group of individuals, making it difficult for dissenting voices to be heard and increasing the pressure to conform.

To protect yourself from the social engineering principle of consensus/social proof, it is essential to maintain a healthy scepticism and independently evaluate the information or requests presented to you. Avoid blindly following the crowd and take the time to critically assess the situation. Verify claims independently, seek multiple perspectives, and be cautious of any tactics that exploit the fear of missing out or create a false sense of popularity.


## Authority and Intimidation

The social engineering principles of authority and intimidation are based on exploiting people's natural inclination to comply with figures of authority or when faced with intimidation. These principles are used to gain control, compliance, or access to information by leveraging power differentials and inducing fear or respect.

Here's how the principles of authority and intimidation can be used in social engineering:

- Impersonating authority figures: Social engineers may impersonate individuals in positions of authority, such as managers, supervisors, IT administrators, or law enforcement officers. By presenting themselves as someone with power and influence, they attempt to gain the trust and compliance of their targets. The perceived authority figure can manipulate targets into following instructions, disclosing sensitive information, or granting access.
- Exploiting hierarchical structures: Social engineers may take advantage of established hierarchies within organizations to exert influence. They might pose as higher-ranking individuals or use their knowledge of organizational structures to navigate and manipulate people within those structures. By exploiting the power dynamics inherent in these hierarchies, they can coerce compliance.
- Using intimidation tactics: Social engineers may employ various tactics to intimidate their targets. This could involve making threats, creating a sense of urgency or consequences for non-compliance, or using fear-inducing language. By instilling fear or anxiety, they attempt to override logical thinking and manipulate their targets into compliance without questioning their actions.
- Leveraging credentials or symbols of authority: Social engineers may present physical or digital credentials, uniforms, or other symbols associated with authority to establish legitimacy. These can create a perception of trustworthiness and increase the likelihood of compliance. For example, wearing a security guard uniform or displaying a fake badge can make targets more willing to cooperate.
- Knowledge exploitation: Social engineers may possess insider knowledge or information about their targets, their organizations, or specific events. By demonstrating this knowledge, they can create an illusion of authority and credibility. The targets may feel compelled to comply based on the assumption that the social engineer has access to privileged information.

It's essential to be cautious when dealing with authority figures or individuals who employ intimidation tactics. Always verify the legitimacy of someone's authority before complying with their requests. If you feel threatened or pressured, take a step back and seek advice or support from trusted sources. Maintain awareness of your rights, organizational policies, and protocols to ensure you don't unwittingly fall victim to social engineering techniques that exploit authority or intimidation.

## Scarcity and Urgency

The social engineering principles of scarcity and urgency exploit people's natural tendency to react quickly and make decisions under conditions of limited availability or time pressure. By creating a sense of scarcity or urgency, social engineers manipulate individuals into taking immediate action without thoroughly evaluating the situation.

Here's how the principles of scarcity and urgency can be used in social engineering:

- Artificial scarcity: Social engineers may create the perception that a resource, opportunity, or information is limited or in high demand. They might claim that there are only a few remaining items, limited seats available, or that time is running out. This scarcity mindset triggers a fear of missing out (FOMO) and motivates individuals to act quickly to secure the perceived limited resource.
- Imposing time constraints: Social engineers often apply time pressure to push individuals into making hasty decisions. They may emphasize the need for immediate action, claiming that delays will lead to negative consequences or missed opportunities. By restricting the time available for consideration, they limit the target's ability to carefully evaluate the situation, increasing the likelihood of compliance.
- Offering exclusive privileges: Social engineers may create an illusion of exclusivity by providing access to restricted information, special deals, or privileged opportunities. They may claim that the offer is only available to a select few or for a limited time. By positioning the opportunity as unique or exclusive, individuals may feel compelled to act quickly to secure the perceived benefits.
- Amplifying consequences: Social engineers may exaggerate the potential negative outcomes of inaction or non-compliance. They might emphasize severe consequences, such as financial loss, missed opportunities, or reputational damage. By amplifying the potential risks, they create a sense of urgency and push individuals to make quick decisions to avoid those consequences.
- Creating a sense of competition: Social engineers may suggest that others are already taking advantage of the opportunity or resource, creating a competitive atmosphere. By portraying the situation as a race against others, individuals may feel pressured to act quickly to stay ahead or secure their share.

To protect yourself from the social engineering principles of scarcity and urgency, it's crucial to remain calm and evaluate the situation objectively. Take the time to assess the legitimacy of the claims and verify information independently. Avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on scarcity or time pressure. Seek multiple perspectives, consult trusted sources, and be cautious of any attempts to rush or manipulate you into immediate action.
