# Threat intelligence sources

Organizations face an ever-increasing number of sophisticated threats from malicious actors. To stay ahead of these threats and protect their digital assets, businesses and cybersecurity professionals rely on threat intelligence. Threat intelligence involves gathering, analysing, and applying information about potential cyber threats to enhance defence strategies. 

A plethora of sources provides valuable threat intelligence, including the mysterious Dark Web and Dark Net, reputable Vendor Websites, Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT), Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs), Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP), Virus Total, and even academic journals, conferences, Request for Comments (RFC), and social media. In this article, we will explore these threat intelligence sources and understand how they contribute to fortifying cybersecurity.

## 1. Dark Web and Dark Net

The Dark Web and Dark Net are terms often used interchangeably, referring to the hidden, unindexed parts of the internet that cannot be accessed using traditional search engines. 

The Dark Net is a hidden part of the internet that is not indexed by traditional search engines and requires specific software, configurations, or credentials to access. It is designed to provide anonymity to users and prevent third parties from identifying the existence of the network or monitoring activities conducted within it. The primary technology enabling this anonymity in the Dark Net is known as "The Onion Router" or Tor.

The Dark Web hosts various websites, marketplaces, and forums where illegal activities, cybercrime tools, and stolen data are exchanged. While the Dark Web is notorious for facilitating cybercrime, it also serves as a valuable threat intelligence source. Security researchers and experts may access the Dark Web to gather information about emerging threats, identify potential data breaches, and gain insights into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by cybercriminals.

## 2. Vendor Websites

Vendor Websites are an essential source of threat intelligence. Cybersecurity vendors and companies often publish security advisories, threat reports, and updates about vulnerabilities and emerging threats. By monitoring these sources, organizations can stay informed about the latest threats and the corresponding patches or security measures to implement.

## 3. Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)

Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) is information that is publicly available and accessible to anyone. OSINT sources include websites, social media platforms, forums, blogs, and news outlets. OSINT can provide valuable insights into threat actor activities, cybersecurity trends, and emerging risks. OSINT research enables organizations to identify potential threats, track threat actors' behaviour, and understand the security landscape.

## 4. Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs)

ISACs are industry-specific organizations established to facilitate the sharing of cyber threat intelligence and best practices among participating companies. ISAC members share threat information anonymously to help each other defend against cyber threats effectively. ISACs serve as trusted forums where organizations can collaborate to enhance their cybersecurity posture.

## 5. Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP)

MISP is an open-source threat intelligence platform designed to facilitate the sharing of structured threat intelligence information. MISP allows organizations and security researchers to share indicators of compromise (IOCs), threat intelligence reports, and other relevant information securely. This collaborative approach enables faster detection and response to cyber threats.

## 6. Virus Total

Virus Total is a web service that aggregates antivirus scan results and analyses suspicious files and URLs. Users can upload files or submit URLs to Virus Total for analysis. The platform provides insights into the detection rates of various antivirus engines and other security products, helping organizations identify potentially malicious files or links.

## Other threat intelligence resources

**-	Academic Journals and Conferences**

Academic journals and conferences play a vital role in advancing threat intelligence research. Security researchers and academics publish their findings on the latest threats, vulnerabilities, and defence strategies. These sources offer valuable insights into cutting-edge cybersecurity research and techniques.

**-	Request for Comments (RFC)**

RFC documents are part of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standardization process. While not specifically focused on threat intelligence, some RFCs address security-related topics, vulnerabilities, and best practices for secure communication protocols.

**-	Social Media**

Social media platforms can also serve as sources of threat intelligence. Security researchers and organizations often share insights and warnings about emerging threats, campaigns, and vulnerabilities on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and specialized security forums.

## Final words

The diverse range of threat intelligence sources, including the enigmatic Dark Web and Dark Net, vendor websites, OSINT, ISACs, MISP, Virus Total, academic journals, conferences, RFCs, and social media, offers invaluable insights into the ever-changing cyber threat landscape. By leveraging these sources, organizations can enhance their understanding of potential threats, identify vulnerabilities, and develop proactive defense strategies. Threat intelligence is a key component in the ongoing battle against cyber threats, and staying informed through diverse sources is crucial for maintaining a strong cybersecurity posture.
