# Prepending


Prepending is the act of adding text, such as "RE:" or "MAILSAFE: PASSED," to an email subject or message body to make it appear more legitimate and trustworthy. This technique aims to increase the likelihood that the recipient will open, trust, and act upon the message.
By using familiar and trusted phrases in the subject line or body of the email, the attacker tries to exploit the recipient's psychological biases and perception of credibility. The added text may create a false sense of urgency, importance, or authenticity, making the email seem like a response to a previous message or a secure communication.
Below are listed some examples of prepending scenarios:

**1.	Email Subject Line Prepending:** *Subject: RE: Urgent - Account Verification Required*

In this example, the attacker prepends "RE:" to the subject line, creating the illusion that the email is a response to a previous conversation or request. This can make the email appear more legitimate and increase the recipient's likelihood of opening it.

**2.	False Trustworthiness Prepending:** *Subject: MAILSAFE: PASSED - Important Security Update*

By prepending "MAILSAFE: PASSED" to the subject line, the attacker aims to make the email appear trustworthy and secure. This text implies that the email has passed security checks or has been verified, potentially luring the recipient into thinking it is a safe communication.

**3.	Urgency Prepending:** *Subject: URGENT: Action Required - Account Suspension Notice*

Prepending "URGENT" to the subject line adds a sense of urgency, pressuring the recipient to act quickly. This psychological manipulation tactic is intended to make the recipient more likely to open the email and follow the instructions provided.

**4.	Pretexting Prepending:** *Subject: RE: Meeting Follow-Up - Important Document Attached*

In this example, the attacker prepends "RE:" to make the email seem like a response to a previous meeting or conversation. This pretexting technique establishes a false sense of familiarity and trust, potentially leading the recipient to open the email and engage with its contents.

These examples highlight how prepending specific phrases or indicators can be used to manipulate recipients into believing that the emails are legitimate, urgent, or secure. It's essential to remain vigilant and apply critical thinking when encountering such emails, verifying the authenticity of the sender and the information provided before taking any actions.

It's crucial to remain cautious and exercise good email security practices, such as verifying the authenticity of emails, double-checking sender addresses, avoiding clicking on suspicious links or attachments, and reporting suspicious emails to the appropriate authorities or IT departments.
