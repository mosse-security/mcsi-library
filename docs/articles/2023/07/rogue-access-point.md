# Rogue Access Points

Rogue Access Points (APs) are unauthorized wireless access points that are connected to a network without the network administrator's knowledge or approval. These rogue APs can pose significant security risks to an organization's network and sensitive data. Rogue APs are a common threat in both corporate environments and public spaces.

Here's how rogue access points can be a security concern:

**1. Unauthorized Network Access:** Rogue APs provide an unauthorized entry point to the organization's network. This can enable attackers or malicious insiders to gain access to the network and its resources without proper authentication or authorization.
   
**2. Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Rogue APs can be used to conduct Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, intercepting and eavesdropping on wireless communications between legitimate devices and legitimate access points. This allows attackers to capture sensitive data, such as login credentials or confidential information.
   
**3. Data Leakage:** If a rogue AP is connected to the corporate network, it may allow unauthorized users to access sensitive company data, putting intellectual property and customer information at risk.
   
**4. Network Spoofing:** Attackers can set up rogue APs with network names (SSIDs) that closely resemble legitimate network names to trick users into connecting to them. This is known as "evil twin" attacks, where users unknowingly connect to the rogue AP, thinking it is a legitimate network.
   
**5. Malware Distribution:** Rogue APs can be used to distribute malware to connected devices, either through malicious software updates or by exploiting vulnerabilities in connected devices.
   
**6. Bandwidth Degradation:** When rogue APs share the same wireless channels as legitimate APs, it can cause interference and degrade the overall network performance.
 
## Preventing Rogue Access Points

To mitigate the risks associated with rogue access points, organizations can implement the following security measures:

**•	Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS):** Deploy WIDS solutions to continuously monitor the wireless environment and detect rogue APs automatically.

**•	Network Segmentation:** Segment the network to limit access to sensitive data and resources. Implementing Virtual LANs (VLANs) can help contain the impact of any successful 
rogue AP attacks.

**•	Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities in the wireless network infrastructure.

**•	Employee Awareness Training:** Educate employees about the risks of connecting to unknown wireless networks and the importance of reporting suspicious wireless activity.

**•	Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong authentication methods, such as WPA2 or WPA3, to secure access to wireless networks.

**•	Physical Security Measures:** Control physical access to network switch rooms and restrict access to networking equipment to authorized personnel only.

## Final Words

By proactively monitoring the wireless environment and implementing robust security measures, organizations can significantly reduce the likelihood of rogue access points compromising their networks and data.
