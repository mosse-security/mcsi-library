# Credential harvesting


Credential harvesting is a technique used by attackers to gather usernames, passwords, or other authentication credentials from unsuspecting individuals or organizations. The goal of credential harvesting is to gain unauthorized access to systems, accounts, or sensitive information. Attackers use various methods to harvest credentials, including:

## 1. Phishing

Phishing attacks typically involve sending deceptive emails, messages, or websites that appear legitimate to trick users into revealing their login credentials. These messages often create a sense of urgency, request users to verify their account information, or provide a link to a malicious website that mimics a legitimate login page.

## 2.	Keylogging

Keyloggers are malicious programs or hardware devices that record keystrokes entered by users on their keyboards. This allows attackers to capture usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information without the user's knowledge.

## 3.	Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks

In a MitM attack, an attacker intercepts the communication between two parties, capturing and potentially modifying the data exchanged. By positioning themselves between the user and a legitimate website or service, the attacker can capture login credentials as the user enters them.

## 4.	Credential Stealing Malware

Malware such as keyloggers, spyware, or password stealers can be surreptitiously installed on a victim's device. These malicious programs silently collect login credentials as the user enters them or extract stored credentials from browsers or password managers.

## 5.	Social Engineering

Social engineering techniques, such as impersonation, pretexting, or baiting, can be used to manipulate individuals into revealing their login credentials willingly. Attackers may pose as trustworthy individuals, such as IT personnel or customer support agents, to deceive users into sharing their usernames and passwords.

To protect against credential harvesting:

1.	Be vigilant about phishing emails, messages, or suspicious websites. Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from untrusted sources.

2.	Regularly update software and operating systems to patch vulnerabilities that attackers may exploit.

3.	Use strong and unique passwords for each online account. Consider using a password manager to securely store and manage credentials.

4.	Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring an additional verification step, such as a temporary code sent to a mobile device.

5.	Educate employees and individuals about the risks of credential harvesting and provide training on recognizing and avoiding social engineering tactics.

6.	Implement robust security measures, such as network firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and anti-malware solutions, to detect and prevent credential harvesting attempts.

Credential harvesting can be employed in cases where malvertising or injected scripts into shopping cart code are used in attacks. Here's how these techniques can be leveraged for credential harvesting:

1.	Malvertising: Malvertising refers to malicious advertisements that are displayed on legitimate websites. Attackers use malvertising to distribute malware or direct users to fraudulent websites designed to harvest credentials. In some cases, malvertisements may redirect users to websites that mimic legitimate login pages, tricking users into entering their credentials, which are then captured by the attacker.

2.	Injected Scripts in Shopping Cart Code: Attackers may compromise the code of shopping cart systems on e-commerce websites by injecting malicious scripts. These scripts can capture and transmit sensitive information, including login credentials, entered by users during the checkout process. This technique allows attackers to collect the credentials of unsuspecting shoppers.

In both cases, the objective is to deceive users into revealing their login credentials, which can then be used by the attacker for unauthorized access or other malicious activities. To protect against credential harvesting in these scenarios, consider the following measures:

1.	Keep systems and software up to date: Regularly update the software running on websites, including shopping cart platforms, to address any known vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit.
2.	Use reputable advertising networks: Work with trusted advertising networks that have security measures in place to mitigate the risk of malvertising. Vet the ads and partners to ensure their legitimacy.
3.	Implement content security policies: Employ content security policies (CSPs) to control and limit the execution of scripts on web pages. CSPs can help prevent the injection of malicious scripts into shopping cart code or other areas of the website.
4.	Website monitoring: Regularly monitor the code and behavior of your website, including shopping cart functionality, to detect any unauthorized changes or malicious injections. Implement web application firewalls (WAFs) and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to identify and block suspicious activities.
5.	Educate users and employees: Raise awareness among users and employees about the risks of malvertising and injected scripts. Train them to recognize suspicious advertisements, avoid clicking on unknown links, and be cautious when entering login credentials on unfamiliar websites.
6.	Implement strong authentication mechanisms: Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to provide an additional layer of security. This ensures that even if login credentials are compromised, an extra verification step is required to gain access.
By taking proactive measures and maintaining awareness of common attack techniques, individuals and organizations can mitigate the risk of falling victim to credential harvesting and protect their sensitive information.
