# Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS)

Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) is a cutting-edge approach that streamlines the exchange of threat intelligence data among organizations and security stakeholders. By automating the process of sharing Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), AIS enables real-time collaboration, enhances situational awareness, and accelerates incident response efforts. In this article, we will define Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) and explore its various components, including Threat Maps, File/Code Repositories, Vulnerability Databases, and Vulnerability Feeds.

## Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS): An Overview

Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) is a standardized method of sharing cyber threat intelligence, enabling the automatic exchange of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and other relevant information among diverse cybersecurity platforms and tools. IOCs are specific artefacts or patterns indicative of malicious activities or potential cyber threats. These may include IP addresses, domain names, URLs, file hashes, and other metadata associated with known malware or suspicious activities.

Key Features of Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS):

**1.	Real-Time Sharing:** AIS facilitates real-time sharing of threat intelligence, ensuring that participating organizations receive timely and relevant information to enhance their defenses.

**2.	Automation and Integration:** AIS automates the process of sharing threat intelligence, reducing the manual effort required and promoting seamless integration between different security systems.

**3.	Data Standardization:** AIS relies on standardized formats such as STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression) and TAXII (Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information) to ensure consistency and compatibility across various threat intelligence platforms.

**4.	Enhanced Collaboration:** By enabling automated sharing, AIS fosters collaboration among organizations, enabling them to pool their resources and collective knowledge to counter cyber threats effectively.

## Threat Maps

Threat Maps are visual representations of cyber threat data and attack patterns, often displayed on geographical or topological maps. These maps provide a comprehensive view of global cyber threats, highlighting the origins of attacks, targeted regions, and the distribution of malicious activities. Threat Maps aggregate real-time data from various sources and can offer valuable insights into the latest cyber threats and emerging attack trends.

## File/Code Repositories

File and code repositories are centralized platforms that store and distribute software components, applications, and source code, for example VirusTotal. In the context of AIS, these repositories serve as databases for storing IOCs and related data, such as malware samples, ransomware variants, and other malicious artifacts. Security researchers and analysts can access these repositories to study and analyze threats, identify new malware strains, and develop countermeasures.

## Vulnerability Databases and Vulnerability Feeds

Vulnerability databases and feeds are critical components of AIS, focusing on providing information about software vulnerabilities and associated exploits. These resources contain details about known vulnerabilities in software applications, operating systems, and network devices. Vulnerability databases offer comprehensive repositories of published vulnerabilities, while vulnerability feeds provide real-time updates on new vulnerabilities and associated risk scores. An example of vulnerability database is operated by Mitre (cve.mitre.org)

## Final words

Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) represents a transformative approach to threat intelligence sharing, enabling organizations to leverage automation and standardized formats to exchange critical cyber threat data seamlessly. With real-time sharing capabilities and enhanced collaboration, AIS empowers cybersecurity professionals to respond proactively to evolving cyber threats. By incorporating Threat Maps, File/Code Repositories, Vulnerability Databases, and Vulnerability Feeds into AIS, organizations can strengthen their defenses and bolster their resilience against cyber adversaries. In an interconnected digital landscape, AIS stands as a cornerstone for a collective and proactive defense against cyber threats.
