# Attributes of threat actor

In today's digital landscape, the cyber threats landscape is constantly evolving, and the actors behind these attacks vary widely in their intentions, capabilities, and resources. Understanding the attributes of cyber threat actors is crucial for cybersecurity professionals and organizations seeking to develop effective defence strategies. This article describes the key attributes that characterize cyber threat actors, including whether they are internal or external, their intent or motivation, level of sophistication or capability, and the resources or funding at their disposal.

## Internal vs. External

One crucial attribute of cyber threat actors is their internal or external origin. Internal threat actors are individuals who are already part of an organization, such as employees, contractors, or partners. They have legitimate access to the organization's network and systems, making them potentially dangerous as they can leverage their insider knowledge to carry out attacks.

External threat actors, on the other hand, originate from outside the organization and attempt to breach its defences. They can include various entities, such as cybercriminals, hacktivists, nation-state actors, and advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. External threat actors often use various attack vectors, such as phishing, malware, and network intrusion, to compromise systems and steal sensitive data.

## Intent/Motivation

Understanding the intent or motivation of cyber threat actors is essential for gauging the severity of potential attacks and developing targeted defence strategies. Different threat actors have distinct motives, ranging from financial gain and espionage to political agendas and ideology-driven hacktivism.

**1.	Financial Gain:** Many cybercriminals are driven by financial motives. They seek to steal sensitive financial data, engage in ransomware attacks, commit identity theft, or engage in fraudulent activities to reap financial rewards.

**2.	Espionage:** Nation-state actors and APT groups are often motivated by espionage. They conduct sophisticated, targeted attacks to gather intelligence, intellectual property, or strategic information.

**3.	Hacktivism:** Hacktivists aim to advance their political or social causes by targeting organizations that they perceive as adversaries or that align with their beliefs.

**4.	Destruction and Disruption:** Some threat actors may be motivated by a desire to cause chaos, destruction, or disruption, without any specific financial gain or political motive.

## Level of Sophistication/Capability

The level of sophistication or capability of cyber threat actors is a critical attribute that impacts the nature and complexity of their attacks. Cyber threat actors can range from low-skilled script kiddies using off-the-shelf tools to highly skilled and well-funded nation-state hacking groups.

**1.	Script Kiddies:** These are individuals with limited technical expertise who use pre-packaged hacking tools or follow online tutorials to launch basic attacks.

**2.	Opportunistic Hackers:** Opportunistic hackers take advantage of known vulnerabilities or widely available attack tools to conduct attacks of opportunity without specific targets in mind.

**3.	Advanced Cybercriminals:** Advanced cybercriminals possess more sophisticated technical skills. They develop custom malware, engage in targeted attacks, and use advanced evasion techniques.

**4.	Nation-State Actors and APT Groups:** Nation-state actors and APT groups are among the most sophisticated threat actors. They have significant resources and conduct highly targeted and stealthy attacks, often focusing on long-term operations.

## Resources/Funding

Another key attribute of cyber threat actors is the resources or funding at their disposal. Well-funded threat actors can afford to invest in sophisticated tools, zero-day exploits, and advanced infrastructure to carry out their attacks.

**1.	Limited Resources:** Some threat actors operate on a shoestring budget, relying on low-cost or free hacking tools and tactics. These actors may primarily engage in opportunistic attacks.

**2.	Organized Cybercriminal Groups:** Organized cybercriminal groups have access to more substantial resources, such as funding from criminal activities, cryptocurrency payments, or the sale of stolen data on the dark web.

**3.	Nation-State and State-Sponsored Actors:** Nation-state and state-sponsored threat actors often have significant funding, advanced tools, and substantial human resources at their disposal. They are capable of conducting highly sophisticated and prolonged cyber campaigns.

## Final words

Understanding the attributes of cyber threat actors is crucial for cybersecurity professionals and organizations seeking to strengthen their defences against evolving cyber threats. By recognizing whether threat actors are internal or external, their intent or motivation, level of sophistication or capability, and the resources or funding they possess, defenders can tailor their strategies to effectively detect, prevent, and respond to cyber-attacks. Cybersecurity is an ongoing battle, and staying vigilant and adaptable in the face of ever-evolving threat actors is paramount for maintaining a secure digital environment.
