# MCSI #025: So you want to become a CISO?

The role of a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is multifaceted and challenging. Understanding the nuances of this position is crucial for anyone aspiring to step into this critical role. Here's what you need to know about becoming a CISO.

## The Many Faces of a CISO

> “Incompatibility between CISOs and their companies can lead to stress, frustration, burnout and rapid turnover. Identify your CISO style to target the ideal role and environment for you.” - Alissa Irei, TechRadar

Did you know there could be as many as 6 different types of CISOs? From technical experts to strategic visionaries, the range is vast. Identifying which type aligns with your skills and aspirations is paramount. Make sure to understand the specific demands of each type to avoid landing in a role that doesn't suit you.

1. Transformational CISO

2. Post-breach CISO

3. Tactical and operational expert CISO

4. Compliance and risk guru CISO

5. Steady-state CISO

6. Customer-facing evangelist CISO

## The Vast Scope of Responsibilities

The CISO bears a vast range of responsibilities, from developing and executing a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy to ensuring regulatory compliance and leading incident response. This role also involves securing organizational assets, managing a dedicated security team, and integrating cybersecurity into all business operations. With a duty to bridge technical and business realms, the CISO's role is critical and wide-ranging, affecting every aspect of an organization's security posture.

## The Budget War

Many CISOs find themselves in a constant struggle for resources. Despite the title, they often don't have the authority to secure the budgets necessary for implementing critical security controls or expanding their teams. This limitation can significantly impact the effectiveness of the organization's security posture.

## The Scapegoat Scenario

```{epigraph}
“I have one piece of advice for you. Whenever you face a breach, open each envelope in turn.

Envelop 1. Blame your predecessor

Envelop 2. Blame your team

Envelop 3. Prepare three envelopes"
```

Being a CISO can sometimes feel thankless. Without major security incidents, their work goes unnoticed, but when a breach occurs, they are often the first to be blamed. This aspect of the role can be particularly challenging, as it requires maintaining robust security measures while being prepared to take responsibility for any lapses.

## Navigating the Political Landscape

> “Bureaucracy is a construction by which a person is conveniently separated from the consequences of his or her actions.” - Nassim Taleb

A CISO’s role is deeply entwined with organizational politics. Reporting structures can vary, with some CISOs answering to the CIO and others directly to the board. Their success depends heavily on their ability to influence other departments and navigate conflicting agendas, making it a highly political role.

Here are three questions you can ask yourself to assess whether you’re ready to be a CISO:

1. Am I capable of navigating corporate politics to advance security priorities?
2. Can I manage relationships with stakeholders who have competing interests?
3. How prepared am I to tackle the ethical and political challenges of being a CISO?

## Ethical Dilemmas

> “How do some organizations meet their cyber obligations and expectations whilst avoiding the high cost of cyber security? They use two business instruments that we call Dark Compliance and Dark Risk Management.” - Benjamin Mossé

Alarmingly, some CISOs are pressured into unethical practices, such as downplaying security incidents or vulnerabilities to save costs or effort. This situation places CISOs in a precarious position, balancing between corporate expectations and ethical standards in cybersecurity management.

## Benjamin’s Advice

Achieving the pinnacle title in cybersecurity is an admirable goal, yet many overlook the immense responsibilities and challenging work environment that come with it. It's essential to stay true to your passion for technology, valuing personal fulfilment over social status. For those aspiring to be CISOs, beginning with "CISO as a Service" can provide practical experience, focusing on real security enhancements. Choose an organization and team that resonate with you.
