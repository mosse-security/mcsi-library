# MCSI #007: What skills must you master if you want to excel as a SOC analyst?

Security Operations Centres (SOCs) are a key part of the technical defence against cyberattacks, and the number of SOCs worldwide is increasing. We are proud to have students who are current or aspiring SOC analysts, and we understand that working as an analyst can be challenging, especially when the SOC is understaffed or has a larger workload than the team can handle.

The information in this newsletter will help those of you who want to become great SOC analysts.

## Let's begin with the challenges...

Here's an **non-exhaustive list** of challenges SOC analysts face:

1. Staying up-to-date on the latest security threats
2. Detecting malicious activity in a timely manner
3. Maintaining a high level of accuracy when analyzing security data
4. Keeping track of a large number of security events
5. Understanding the context of different security events
6. Developing and maintaining proactive security measures
7. Working with limited time and resources
8. Ensuring compliance with applicable regulations
9. Understanding the nuances of different security tools
10. Collaborating with other teams and stakeholders

Many cybersecurity functions are overburdened with responsibilities; however, the SOC is expected to handle a very large variety of technical tasks. This expectation is generally higher than other functions within the cybersecurity team.

## Lesson 1: Master organizational skills

As SOC analyst, you are expected to manage a variety of tasks on a daily basis. While some of these tasks may be routine, others may require critical thinking, analysis and communication. Therefore, it is important to approach tasks in a well-organized manner.

- Create a to-do list and prioritize tasks
- Set realistic goals and deadlines
- Break down large projects into small tasks
- Keep a calendar and set reminders
- Use folders, labels, and other organizational tools

It is likely that your organization has established protocols and procedures for efficient operations. We suggest that you become proficient in the tools and techniques available to you in order to maintain productivity and collaborate with fellow team members.

## Lesson 2: Boost your foundational knowledge and abilities

Fundamental skills are essential for a SOC analyst as they are the core building blocks that are necessary in order to be successful in the profession. Advanced skills, while important, are not required as often and are not always applicable in every situation.

- Here's the list of fundamental SOC knowledge and skills:
- Knowledge of computer networks, operating systems and cloud platforms
- Knowledge of common attack techniques, patterns and tools
- Ability to install, configure and manage security tools
- Ability to investigate and troubleshoot IT faults
- Ability to synthesize technical information and communicate effectively

Having a strong foundation in the fundamental skills will allow you to perform your job more efficiently and effectively, and provide you with the ability to quickly learn and apply any additional skills that may be required. We advise you to take advantage of any chance you have to learn and master these abilities.

## Lesson 3: Refine and enhance your soft skills

It is often believed that one possesses excellent soft skills, however, it is worth considering how one's co-workers and colleagues view these soft skills. With many years of experience in the cybersecurity industry, we have come to understand that soft skills can always be improved, and there is no exception to this.

- **Stakeholder analysis** is an important process that assists with identifying, assessing, and managing the expectations and interests of those impacted by our actions. Are you mapping stakeholders for all our work? Are you taking the time to understand their needs, wants, and expectations? How successful are you in meeting all their requirements?

- **Active Listening** is an essential communication technique that involves focusing intently on the speaker, accurately comprehending their message, and responding appropriately. Are the individuals you collaborate with confident that you have attentively listened to them?

- **Collaboration** is the act of working together to accomplish a shared objective. Are tasks delegated effectively? Is knowledge imparted in an efficient manner? Are the requirements of others being met? Is working together an enjoyable experience for all involved?

- **Writing professionally** is an important skill to demonstrate effective communication. Are you drafting professional emails, reports, or presentations? It is important to ensure that your writing is clear, concise, and adheres to accepted conventions and standards.

## Lesson 4: Put it in writing how you want people to remember working with you

A powerful professional development exercise could be to dedicate some time to thinking about how you would like to be remembered by colleagues and peers when working with them. Taking a pen and paper to a café or park for at least two hours could help with this process. Consider asking yourself questions such as 'How do I want the experience of working with me to be remembered?'.

Consider the following dimensions:

- What values do I want to convey?
- Do I want to be remembered for my professionalism, creativity, or problem-solving capabilities?
- How do I want people to feel when working with me?
- What do I want to be remembered for in terms of my attitude and behavior?
- What impact do I want to have on my team's performance?
- What qualities should I focus on developing to ensure my legacy at work?
