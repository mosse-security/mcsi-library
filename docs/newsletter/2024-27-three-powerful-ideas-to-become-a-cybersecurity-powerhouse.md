# MCSI #027: Three Powerful Ideas to Become a Cybersecurity Powerhouse

Dive into this newsletter to unlock powerful ideas that will transform your approach, giving you a deeper, more nuanced understanding of cybersecurity. These insights are designed to challenge and refine your thinking, equipping you to excel in your field.

## Idea #1 - Turn Errors into Opportunities

> “Learn all the ways software developers and system administrators get confused about cybersecurity.“ - Benjamin Mossé

In offensive security, it's key to know where software developers and system admins often slip up with cybersecurity. Many think that just having strong passwords or the latest updates keeps systems safe. But, these ideas can miss bigger threats and leave gaps for hackers. Offensive security pros need to dig into these common mistakes to find and fix security holes better.

Looking at real incidents helps a lot. For example, studying a case where too much trust in encryption led to a data leak shows the danger of such mistakes. These stories teach important lessons, showing how overlooking simple security aspects can lead to big problems.

1. Make an inventory of all the vulnerability classes
2. Identify software historically affected by these vulnerabilities
3. Read the code that developers wrote to patch the bugs
4. Track on some of the best bug bounty hunters are discovering their best bugs
5. Setup your own test lab and build an inventory of configuration errors that could lead to security vulnerabilities

## Idea #2 - Systematic Approaches Win

> “Use a systematic approach to solving problems and making decisions.” - Benjamin Mossé

A systematic approach in incident response and malware analysis is key because it ensures every part of the cybersecurity puzzle is addressed. It’s not just about following steps in order; it's about looking at the whole picture and connecting all the dots. This means analyzing every aspect of the incident or malware to understand the full scope of the threat. By doing this, you ensure that you're not just putting a temporary fix on a problem but are thoroughly eliminating the root cause and preventing future issues.

In simpler terms, think of it as putting together a complete map of an attack or malware behavior. Instead of just patching holes, you're understanding how and why they appeared and how everything is interconnected. This comprehensive view allows for smarter, more effective decisions.

## Idea #3 - How Refutations Drive Progress in Cybersecurity

> “Never act on a refuted idea.” - Elliot Temple

Karl Popper, a philosopher of science, argued that knowledge progresses through a cycle of conjectures and refutations. According to Popper, we gain knowledge by proposing theories (conjectures) and then testing these theories against evidence, trying to refute them. This process of critical testing and attempting to falsify ideas helps us eliminate those that don’t hold up to scrutiny, thereby moving closer to the truth.

Applying Popper’s philosophy to cybersecurity management, the idea is that leaders should approach problems by forming hypotheses or strategies (conjectures) and then critically evaluating and testing them (refutations). The value of criticism here is immense: it’s a tool that helps to clarify what works and what doesn’t. By rigorously testing ideas and being open to finding flaws, leaders can discard ineffective strategies (refuted ideas) and refine their approach.

So, in practice, a cybersecurity leader should foster an environment where strategies and decisions are constantly scrutinized.

1. Pick an idea of your choice (could be anything)
2. Identify what problem the idea is trying to solve (it’s goal)
3. Produce a refutation for the idea by explaining why the idea doesn’t achieve the goal (source: Elliot Temple)
