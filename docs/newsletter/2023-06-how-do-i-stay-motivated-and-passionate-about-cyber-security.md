# MCSI #006: How do I stay motivated and passionate about cyber security?

Have you ever considered giving up on cybersecurity? You are not alone. Many people experience burnout, lack of satisfaction, and disappointment with their career path. Common reasons for quitting include:

1. Unmotivating work environment due to a suboptimal manager or lack of stimulating tasks
2. Difficulty in mastering the necessary skills or feeling that progress is slow
3. Dissatisfaction with the career outcomes achieved

**At the same time, I’ve observed that many of our students struggle to reach their career goals due to quitting too soon.** If they had continued to work hard for just a few more months, I am confident that they would have been able to progress their abilities and advance their careers. Therefore, the topic of this newsletter is highly pertinent. How can one remain motivated and passionate about cybersecurity?

## Recharge your body and mind

> “20 minutes of awe twice a day is cheaper than a holiday.”

It is essential to learn techniques that can help you recharge.

For instance, take a 20-minute walk every day. During your stroll, pay close attention to your surrounding area. Allow yourself to reach a tranquil state of mind. You will likely experience a decrease in mental stress. Your muscles will be more relaxed. The things that were weighing on your mind will take on a new context, enabling you to be more understanding of yourself and others.

Achieving inner quietude is also possible through awe. Some of the reliable ways to experience awe include contemplating a big idea, listening to peaceful music and thinking of acts of moral beauty.

I suggest that you look into the work of Dr. Dacher Keltner if you are eager to find out the science behind awe and how it can improve your health and wellbeing.

## Harness the power of curiosity

> “How does this work?” and “Could this idea work?” is how cybersecurity projects begin.

Luckily, cybersecurity is a wide and ever-growing field. This provides an ongoing opportunity for curiosity and intrigue. Use curiosity to motivate yourself and invigorate your enthusiasm.

- Have weekend research projects
- Read the source code of tools to understand how they work
- Make time to learn new techniques, tactics and tools

Select something that piques your interest and explore it. Let curiosity be your guide.

## Connect your work to a higher purpose

> “Remind yourself of why you chose this career in the first place.”

Most of you have chosen to pursue a career in cybersecurity because you understand the negative impact of cybercrime on society and you want to make a contribution in addressing the issue.

It is important to remain connected to this purpose. You must often remind yourself of why you began this journey in the first place.

It is also essential to understand that cybersecurity is unlikely to be solved within your lifetime. Therefore, the best thing you can do is enhance your knowledge and skills so that when given the chance to make a difference, you are ready and confident in your abilities.

## Aim for the long run

> “Think of your journey as a 100,000 hours ultramarathon, not a 24-hour hackathon.”

Many of you have likely begun cybersecurity with incorrect expectations. It can be easy to assume that with a few courses and some hard work, you'll soon be able to master the field. The truth is, however, that cybersecurity is challenging and building a successful career in the field takes years of dedication. You will encounter many obstacles, and your attempts to overcome them will not always be successful. That's why it's essential to maintain your passion for cybersecurity and continue striving to reach your goals.

- Win through grit and perseverance
- Grind in silence and learn to love it
- Do the basic tasks exceptionally well
- Break big goals into milestones, and divide milestones into tasks
- Look for beauty and awe in cybersecurity materials
