# MCSI #001: Learn how to become an ethical hacker and get paid to hack

Many of you may be aspiring to become an ethical hacker - a job that is both fun, rewarding, and challenging. With the increasing popularity of Bug Bounty Programs, there is an unparalleled amount of work in this field.

Here's my story of how I got into penetration testing:

- Starting writing web applications at age 8
- Discovered hacking at age 12
- Published 100s of security advisories in vulnerable PHP applications by age 16
- Worked several freelance jobs as a developer and never got paid
- Landed my first paid penetration testing job at age 19
- Generated 200K as a pentester before age 22

This was all before Bug Bounties were established. With the right mindset and training program, it is entirely possible for you to exceed my financial success.

## Step 1: Adopt the Hacker Ethic

People talk about the Hacker Mindset, but I prefer the Hacker Ethic:

> "The Hacker Ethic, which instructs you to keep working until your hack tops previous efforts."
> Steven Levy, Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution

**You must strive to outdo what you have achieved in the past.**

To be a successful hacker, it is essential to cultivate a mindset of continuous improvement. This requires dedication, faith in yourself, and hard work.

## Step 2: Stay focused and go deep

One key piece of advice that every penetration tester I know gives beginners is to stay focused and go deep. This is what Nathan Wakelam answered when asked what advice he would give himself if he could go back in time:

```

Many of you aren't focused enough. You get distracted by new shiny ideas, tools, platforms, and certifications. You don't go deep enough on anything.

If you want to improve your cyber skills and be successful in the field of penetration testing, here's some advice I recommend you follow in 2023:

1. Learn system administration (both Windows and Linux)
2. Enhance your knowledge and learn how vulnerabilities work at a code-level by coding vulnerable applications
3. Augment your online research competencies with OSINT skills

**Mastering the fundamentals that apply to all cyber domains is a sure way to succeed!**

## Step 3: Focus on competencies, not certifications

Certifications do not help unemployed people obtain jobs, according to 61% of them.

```

Too many of you are fixated on collecting certifications; however, employers are really looking for competencies!

Your capacity to generate revenue is closely related to the problems you can solve.

Companies pay people to solve problems, not to have certificates.

**Your objective for 2023 should be to gain skills that are worth paying for.**
