# MCSI #020: Learn how to lead and inspire cyber teams

In the intricate realm of cybersecurity, team leadership extends beyond the realm of technical knowledge and expertise. The role of a leader in cyber teams is a complex one that requires a delicate balance between strategic foresight, technical acumen, and, crucially, effective communication. As the cyber landscape evolves at a fast pace, so does the importance of fostering a robust line of communication within cyber teams. A leader's ability to clearly convey goals, expectations, and feedback can make the difference between a team that merely functions and one that truly excels. In this newsletter, we delve into the art of leading and inspiring cyber teams, focusing on bridging communication gaps, staying connected with analysts, and setting clear, actionable goals. Let's embark on this exploration together, unraveling the keys to successful leadership in the dynamic field of cybersecurity.

# Unravelling Communication Breakdowns

> “I remember a situation where the CISO of a large corporation thought that pouring resources into cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies was the key to enhancing the organization's security. However, the analysts on the ground in the Security Operations Center had a different perspective. They needed training to address some skill gaps. They were experiencing burnout. Many of their incident response processes were not working against real cases. The misalignment of priorities resulted in resources being wasted, and more importantly, the organization's security didn't improve. It was a classic case of communication breakdown.” - Benjamin Mossé

Communication, the lifeblood of any effective team, can often pose a challenge in the technical world of cybersecurity. As a leader, you may find yourself in a position where your instructions seem clear as day to you, yet they're perceived as hieroglyphics to your analysts. Or, perhaps, it's the other way around — your analysts' updates read like an alien language, leaving you scrambling to piece together the puzzle.

This disconnect isn't uncommon, and it's certainly not a reflection of anyone's competence. It's simply a manifestation of the inherent complexity in the field of cybersecurity. As a leader, it's your role to bridge this gap and cultivate a shared language within your team.

Let's take a deeper dive into these issues:

**1.1 The Language Gap**

In cybersecurity, the language gap can occur when leaders and analysts operate at different technical levels or specialize in different domains. This gap can lead to misunderstandings and confusion, and it's a primary contributor to communication breakdowns.

**1.2 Differences in Perspective**

Leaders and analysts often have different perspectives on issues, primarily due to their different roles. While leaders focus on the big picture, analysts are typically more detail-oriented. This difference in perspective can sometimes lead to miscommunication.

**1.3 Loss of Moral**

Yet another widespread cause for communication breakdown is the misallocation of time and resources on tasks and meetings that don't address the core issues at hand. Leaders may set numerous meetings and assign various tasks with the intent of solving problems. However, if these activities are not directly addressing the significant problems the team faces, they can lead to fatigue, frustration, and a sense of stagnation. More importantly, they divert critical resources away from where they're needed most, thereby weakening the organization's cybersecurity posture.

## How Leaders Can Stay in Touch with Analysts

> “Cheating and covering up are natural by-products of a top-down culture that does not accept “no” or “it can't be done” for an answer. But combining this culture with a belief that a brilliant strategy formulated in the past will hold indefinitely into the future becomes a certain recipe for failure.” - Dr. Amy C. Edmondson

The first step to effective leadership is understanding your team. Cybersecurity analysts are at the front line, dealing with an ever-evolving threat landscape, and often have insights that can be instrumental in strategic decision-making. But how can leaders stay in touch with their analysts amidst their own demanding roles? Here are a few strategies:

1. **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule regular one-on-one meetings with each team member. These meetings should be an open forum for the analysts to discuss their challenges, successes, and ideas. This not only helps leaders stay informed about the day-to-day operations but also makes team members feel valued and heard.

2. **Open Communication Channels:** Promote a culture of open communication where team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas. This could be through regular team meetings, an open-door policy, or using collaborative tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams. Remember, communication is a two-way street, and leaders should also share updates, feedback, and acknowledgments regularly.

3. **Hands-On Leadership:** While it may not always be possible, leaders should strive to spend some time 'in the trenches' with their analysts. This could mean participating in a few operational tasks or sitting in on a shift now and then. This hands-on approach can provide invaluable insights into the challenges your team faces and foster mutual respect and understanding.

4. **Continuous Learning:** Cybersecurity is a rapidly evolving field, and what worked yesterday may not work today. Leaders should stay abreast of the latest threats, technologies, and methodologies, and encourage their team to do the same. This not only helps in making informed decisions but also facilitates meaningful discussions with your team.

Remember, staying in touch isn't about micromanaging your team but about understanding them better to lead them more effectively. When leaders are in touch with their team's reality, they can provide the right support, make better decisions, and ultimately, inspire their team towards success.

## How to Give Clear Instructions and Goals

> “Empower Others to Act. Remove as many barriers as possible so that those who want to make the vision a reality can do so. Encourage others to remove barriers and make true innovation happen.” - Dr. John P. Kotter

A team without clear instructions and goals is like a ship without a rudder; it might move, but it won't get anywhere meaningful. This is particularly true in the dynamic world of cybersecurity, where clarity of mission and role is critical. Here are some strategies leaders can use to ensure their instructions and goals are clear:

1. **Set SMART Goals:** The best goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART). By setting SMART goals, you provide your team with a clear path and a meaningful target. When everyone knows what they're working towards, they can focus their efforts and work more effectively.

2. **Clear and Concise Instructions:** When assigning tasks, be clear and concise. Provide all the necessary details, including the task's objective, deadline, and any relevant guidelines or constraints. Encourage questions and ensure your team understands the task before they start.

3. **Regular Feedback:** Providing regular feedback is a crucial part of clear communication. Feedback helps your team understand what they're doing well and where they can improve. It's also an opportunity for you to realign their efforts with the team's goals if necessary.

4. **Open Dialogue:** Encourage an open dialogue about your team's goals and tasks. This means not only being open to questions and feedback but actively seeking it. Your team's insights can help you set more effective goals and improve your instructions.

5. **Alignment with Vision:** Lastly, ensure that all goals and tasks align with the broader vision of your organization. When your team understands how their work contributes to the bigger picture, it provides a sense of purpose and motivation.

By providing clear instructions and setting clear goals, you empower your team to perform at their best. This clarity reduces confusion, increases efficiency, and improves overall team morale. After all, a team that knows precisely what they're aiming for is much more likely to hit the target.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, as a leader in cybersecurity, it's imperative to understand the nuanced dance of communication, to immerse yourself in the challenges your analysts face, and to set goals that not only make sense, but also inspire.
