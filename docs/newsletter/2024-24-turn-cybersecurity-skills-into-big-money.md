# MCSI #024: Turn cybersecurity skills into big money

Welcome to our latest issue, where we delve into the potent formula that ties accountability, skills, and leverage to financial success in the cybersecurity realm. In this edition, we'll explore how enhancing accountability can directly boost your revenue, why advancing your skills reduces risks and increases earnings, and how leveraging your assets and expertise maximizes your financial potential. Join us as we unravel these interconnected pathways to prosperity, demonstrating that in the world of cybersecurity, strategic investments in these areas can lead to substantial monetary rewards.

## More Responsibility = More Money

Accountability leads to higher income because it establishes you as a reliable and essential professional. When you consistently demonstrate accountability, you're showing that you can be trusted to meet commitments and deliver results. This reliability makes you invaluable to your team or organization, leading to better job security, opportunities for advancement, and higher salary offers. In essence, being accountable makes you stand out as a professional who adds significant value, and this is often rewarded with greater financial compensation.

## More Skills = More Money

Enhancing your skills in cybersecurity means you bring more value to your role, leading directly to higher income. As you develop a broader range of skills, you become more versatile and capable of handling diverse responsibilities, making you an indispensable part of the team. This increased capability and versatility mean you can take on more significant projects and roles, which naturally come with better pay. Essentially, the more skilled you are, the more you can contribute to your organization's success, and this contribution is often rewarded with increased financial compensation.

## More Leverage = More Money

> “We live in an age of infinite leverage, and the economic rewards for genuine intellectual curiosity have never been higher.” - Naval Ravikant

Gaining more leverage in cybersecurity equates to having greater influence and control over your career and income. Leverage can come from various sources, such as your reputation, expertise, network, or the critical role you play in your organization. When you have leverage, you have the power to negotiate better terms for your job, whether it’s a higher salary, better benefits, or more favorable working conditions. Essentially, the more leverage you have, the more you can dictate your financial terms, leading to increased earnings. This is because you're in a position to offer something valuable that your employer or clients want to retain, giving you an advantage in financial negotiations.

Here are some examples of leverage:

- “I have a good reputation”

- “I have a network of high-value employers”

- “I’m capable of building products”

- “I own a database of people with cyber skills”

- “I have an online product that makes money whilst I sleep”

- “I have money invested that makes money whilst I sleep”

- “I own a podcast that brings me opportunities”

- “I have a rolodex of customers that I can call and do deals with”
