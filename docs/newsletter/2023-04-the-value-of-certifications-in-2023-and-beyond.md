# MCSI #004: The value of certifications in 2023 and beyond

If you are subscribed to this newsletter, it is likely that you are invested in advancing your career in the field of cybersecurity. You may be questioning which certification will best suit your ambitions, while also encountering a large number of companies and high-profile individuals on social media claiming that certifications are obsolete.

For example, this is what [Dragos](https://www.dragos.com/) thinks of certifications:

This newsletter will explore the value of cybersecurity certifications in 2023 and beyond.

For your information, at MCSI, we initially did not plan to become a provider of certifications, as our focus was on competencies. However, we soon realized that our training would not be accepted without the issuance of credentials. Therefore, we are now issuing certificates.

## The case for obtaining certifications

The value of certifications should not be overlooked.

1. Many recruiters consider certifications to be a necessary part of a profile, making it more attractive to potential employers.

2. Obtaining certification can be a great way to structure and drive one's learning journey, while also holding oneself accountable to a given timeline.

3. Some organizations have mandatory requirements which require specific certifications; in these cases, not having the required certifications would make you ineligible.

**If you wish to pursue a career in the public sector or if your employer requires a specific certification, taking the necessary steps to acquire it is essential.** While the certification may not be the most up-to-date or relevant, it is a requirement and therefore, it is necessary to comply. Convincing a large organization to alter their policy is unlikely, so adhering to the standard is highly recommended.

## The case against certifications

It is often suggested that IT certifications lead to job opportunities. However, research conducted by Pearson VUE revealed that IT certifications are not effective in this regard. In fact, the survey results were so unfavourable that in 2021, the results were separated into two categories in order to give the impression that the credentials were more valuable than was actually the case.

When participants were asked whether their IT certifications had aided them in making a job transition or obtaining employment, they had the option to answer "Yes", "No", or "Not yet, but I'm still hopefully". The third option was included to reduce the number of "No" responses and should be treated as "No".

```

- 58% of people who invested in IT certifications did not find them valuable for a job change

- 61% of people who invested in IT certifications did not find them valuable for finding work whilst they were under or unemployed

Regardless of the research consulted, the conclusion is the same: **the importance of certifications is diminishing and those looking to secure employment with the aid of certifications are disheartened to discover that many employers do not consider them to be of high importance.**

## Beware of mercenary certification providers

The proliferation of mercenary certification providers is concerning, as even well-respected institutions are accused of charging exorbitant annual fees for no tangible benefit to the student.

```
Here are common issues that students complain about:

- Training materials could have been found online for free

- Content is outdated and not relevant to what the industry is looking for

- Certification is theoretical. Even if it contains a practical component, then the hands-on practice doesn't meet industry requirements

- Fees are exorbitant and require to go into debt or spend significant personal savings

- After the certification has been obtained, yearly fees must be paid to “maintain” it

- Instructors have no real-world cybersecurity experience

- No free trials available to test whether course and teaching method are suitable

- Unable to receive a full or partial refund if electing to leave the course

- Cost of online version is close to identical to the classroom version

It is understandable that you may not be pleased with all certification providers but **it is important to ensure that you are not taken advantage of by unfair pricing and terms and conditions.** In the long run, it may be beneficial to choose a provider that you are less fond of, but is honest. Once you have started your career and can properly evaluate the value of the certification market, you can then select providers that have different values.

## TL;DR

- Certifications do not guarantee of employment
- Be aware of mercenary training providers
- Prioritize competencies over certifications
- It is possible to begin learning cybersecurity at a low cost or for free
