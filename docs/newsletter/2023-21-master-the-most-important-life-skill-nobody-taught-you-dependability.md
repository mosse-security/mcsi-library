# MCSI #021: Master the most important life skill nobody taught you - Dependability

Have you ever wondered what the most important life skill is that can significantly boost your cybersecurity career, yet nobody ever taught you? It's not a new coding language or a secret hacking technique, but a foundational characteristic - dependability.

In this week's edition of our newsletter, we dive into the heart of this essential quality. Dependability is not just about showing up on time or meeting deadlines; it’s about becoming a pillar of trust, someone who can be relied upon no matter the situation. It is this quiet yet powerful skill that can truly set you apart in the cybersecurity world.

## Dependability: A Life Skill That Sets You Apart

> “Leadership is about making others better as a result of your presence and making sure that impact lasts in your absence.” - Sheryl Sandberg

In the world of cybersecurity, where each new day could bring a different challenge, dependability becomes more than just a virtue; it becomes a necessity. It's about more than being the first one in the office or the last one to leave. Dependability in the cybersecurity realm means that you're the person who steps up when a data breach happens at 3 AM or when the team needs someone to double-check code before a crucial update.

Dependability shines through not just in times of crisis but also in everyday tasks. It's reflected when you deliver your work on time, when you follow protocols to a tee, and when you help a colleague understand a complex problem. It's about being someone your team can rely on, not occasionally, but consistently. **This consistent performance builds a reputation of reliability that distinguishes you in your field. In a landscape filled with complexity and uncertainty, your dependability can be the steadying force that helps navigate the storm.**

## Building Dependability: Strategies and Techniques

> “Trust is the glue of life. It's the most essential ingredient in effective communication. It's the foundational principle that holds all relationships.” - Stephen Covey

Building dependability is akin to constructing a solid foundation; it's not glamorous, but it's critical for the structure that stands on it. So, how do we develop this cornerstone trait? First and foremost, commit to your tasks. Once you've agreed to take on a task or a role, see it through to the end. This creates a sense of responsibility and sets the stage for building trust among your colleagues.

Time management is another crucial aspect. Dependable professionals respect deadlines and understand the ripple effect a delay can have on a project. Utilize productivity tools, set reminders, and prioritize tasks to ensure you're meeting, if not exceeding, timelines.

Lastly, be open and communicate. If a challenge arises that might prevent you from fulfilling a commitment, let your team know at the earliest. Proactive communication indicates a problem-solving attitude and strengthens trust. **Remember, dependability isn't about perfection; it's about accountability, commitment, and the courage to navigate obstacles.**

## Dependability: A Commitment to Yourself and Others

> “In looking for people to hire, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence and energy. And if they do not have the first, the other two will kill you.” - Warren Buffett

Dependability isn’t just an attribute that impacts your professional standing. It’s a commitment you make to yourself and others. It reflects your personal integrity, your reliability, and it's a measure of how much you value your own word. When you commit to being dependable, you commit to following through on your responsibilities, and this reinforces your self-confidence and self-esteem.

Equally, your dependability is a commitment to your team, your organization, and your clients. It's about trust. When you consistently deliver on your promises, people can trust in your work and in your character. This trust fosters stronger, more effective relationships, leading to better teamwork and ultimately, better outcomes for all.

Dependability is a commitment to excellence. By honoring your commitments, respecting deadlines, and communicating proactively, you set a standard of professionalism that not only elevates your career, but also positively impacts everyone you work with. It's an essential life skill that drives personal growth and professional success.
