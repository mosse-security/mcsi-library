Finding a mentor is an invaluable way to learn cybersecurity and develop into a successful professional. A mentor can help guide you through the complexities of the field, provide insight that can only be gained through experience, and offer advice on how to manage the multitude of challenges that come with pursuing a career in cybersecurity. Furthermore, having a mentor can open up networking opportunities that can help you make important contacts and build relationships with industry professionals. A mentor can also provide important feedback and support in your growth as a cybersecurity professional.

Trying to find a mentor can be a daunting task, and it's important to make sure you go about it in the right way. Unfortunately, there are some bad ways to try and find a mentor, such as relying solely on online searches, sending unsolicited emails, or expecting someone to take you on as a mentee without any effort on your part. While these methods may appear to be the easiest, they can often be ineffective and lead to disappointing results.

## Communication Etiquette

Creating a successful and meaningful mentor-mentee relationship requires effort and dedication from both parties. In order to make sure that the relationship is as productive and beneficial as possible, it is important to follow certain key steps. This list provides some useful tips and guidelines that will help you to get the most out of your mentor-mentee relationship.

- Write professional emails and messages
- Listen carefully and actively
- Make sure to express what you want to get out of the relationship
- Prepare for each conversation with a list of topics to discuss
- Respect your mentor’s time and availability
- Maintain regular communication and follow-ups
- Be honest and transparent about your progress and challenges
- Show your appreciation for your mentor's input and feedback
- Be open to feedback and willing to make changes
- Keep the focus on your goals and how your mentor can help you reach them

## Demonstrate that you're serious

> “I am inundated with requests from students who want me to be their mentor. Unfortunately, only a tiny fraction of them take the initiative to complete even a novice exercise on our platform, which is indicative of their lack of commitment to pursuing a career in cybersecurity.” - Benjamin Mossé

Demonstrating commitment is critical when seeking a mentor, as it shows that you are serious about your goals and willing to do the hard work necessary to reach them. Mentors want to invest their time and energy in someone who is willing to invest in themselves. Showing commitment shows that you are serious about your future, and that you are willing to commit to the process of learning and growing under their guidance. It also signals to the mentor that you will take their advice and guidance seriously, and will put in the effort to apply it to your life.

Produce all these documents and show them to your prospective mentor:

- Portfolio of demonstrated cybersecurity skills
- Curriculum vitae
- Certificates of completion
- Personal projects (e.g., Github repository)
- Career goals and aspirations
- List of initial questions you wish to ask the mentor

## Where can I find mentors?

The best places to find a mentor are typically online forums, training platforms, and conferences. Online forums are a great way to connect with people in cybersecurity who can offer advice and guidance. Training platforms offer great resources to learn from and also allow you to connect with others who may be willing to serve as mentors. Conferences are also a great way to network and find potential mentors as they provide an opportunity to meet individuals in person and discuss potential opportunities. Additionally, many conferences offer mentorship programs which are a great way to get connected with someone who is willing to offer their time and advice.

## How do I identify a prospective mentor?

To identify if someone could be a mentor, look for qualities such as experience, knowledge and expertise in a particular area, as well as qualities such as compassion, patience and kindness. Additionally, look for someone who is a good listener and can empathize with the individual they are mentoring. Finally, look for a person who is willing to share their own experiences and offer constructive advice and feedback.

- Do you see them invest time and energy helping people out?
- Do they have practical experience, knowledge, and expertise in the area you’re interested in?
- Do they have a track record of mentoring?
- Are they willing to share their own experiences?

## Have the right expectations

When getting a mentor, it is important to have realistic expectations. A mentor should not be expected to have all the answers or solve all of your problems. Instead, a mentor should act as a sounding board, providing you with advice, guidance, and support as you work to achieve your goals. A mentor should also be a source of motivation, helping you develop and refine your skills, and providing you with the tools and resources you need to be successful. It is important to keep in mind that a mentor relationship is a two-way street, and you should also be willing to learn and take responsibility for your own successes and failures.
