# MCSI #014: Do you want to grow into an excellent student? Master this approach!

In our latest review of cybersecurity students, we have examined the work of thousands and held one-on-one discussions with hundreds of individuals. We are pleased to present our findings in the attached diagram:

```

While the proportions shown are rough estimates, we have identified several key trends that warrant attention:

- Firstly, we have observed that the majority of individuals interested in cybersecurity are unable to produce any meaningful work.

- Secondly, a small fraction of cybersecurity students resort to plagiarism in their attempts to enter the field.

- Thirdly, most students are currently in the learning phase, with a significant discrepancy in the quality of their submissions.

- Lastly, we are impressed with a small group of individuals who consistently produce exceptional work that stands out.

In this newsletter, we will impart a method for improving the quality of your work and get more out of your studies.

## Step 1 - Research, Understand and Plan (RUP)

It is common for many students to dive right into solving an exercise without fully comprehending it or devising a plan. However, it is essential to acknowledge that in the professional field, such an approach is rarely effective. The first step towards success is to ensure a thorough understanding of the task at hand, followed by a detailed plan on how to approach and solve it. By taking the time to understand and plan before execution, you can improve the quality of your work and achieve more efficient and effective results.

```

In addition to being a practical tool, a plan is also an essential demonstration of your comprehension of the exercise and the ultimate goal(s) you have been assigned. A well-crafted plan provides clarity on the steps needed to achieve your objectives, as well as a roadmap for efficient and effective execution. It shows your commitment to producing high-quality work and your ability to approach problems in a thoughtful and strategic manner. We encourage you to take the time to develop a comprehensive plan before embarking on any exercise, as it will enable you to work more efficiently and confidently towards achieving your goals.

## Step 2 - Build a Proof-of-Concept (POC)

The primary objective of a POC (Proof of Concept) is to enable the process of trial and testing. It is designed to validate your understanding of the exercise, highlight any areas of uncertainty, and facilitate the exploration of potential solutions, even if this requires simplifying complex elements of the problem.

The ultimate goal is to arrive at a comprehensive understanding of the exercise, with every fact solved and functioning appropriately in a test environment. By approaching a POC in this manner, you can effectively identify and address potential issues and produce a solution that meets the objectives of the exercise.

```

To ensure the most effective outcome, it is highly recommended to engage in brainstorming and evaluation of multiple solutions before conducting testing. During this process, it is important to ask yourself the following question: "Which solution is the easiest, safest, and most efficient to test?" At times, it is tempting to opt for complex solutions; however, this approach may result in unnecessary difficulties and setbacks. By considering simpler and more straightforward solutions, you can increase the likelihood of achieving the desired outcome and save time and resources.

## Step 3 - Reflect, Refine and Finalize (RRF)

> “Average students submit a proof-of-concept, but exceptional students submit a finished product.” - Benjamin Mossé

Upon reaching the final stage of producing a finished product, it is crucial to engage in a thorough reflection on the entire process. This reflection should encompass a deep examination of the work completed thus far, with a focus on identifying areas for potential improvement or optimization.

```

To guide this process, it is recommended to ask yourself questions such as "What solution best meets the needs of the industry?" or "How would this function in a real-world scenario?". This act of introspection can reveal insights that may prompt a complete rewrite or a refinement of certain elements of the POC. By undertaking this reflection, you can produce a finished product that reflects the highest standard of quality.

## How much time does this approach take? What are the benefits?

Are you on the fence about this approach? Let's compare three students:

Undoubtedly, the approach recommended in this newsletter may require additional time and effort on your part. However, it is important to note that this investment can ultimately save you time and resources in the long run, as it minimizes the chances of having to make extensive revisions.

Moreover, **the ultimate goal is to achieve a successful career outcome, which can be greatly enhanced by submitting high-quality work.** As demonstrated by the two students who put in additional effort and were recognized with trophies, producing "finalized products" that meet or exceed industry standards can open up new opportunities and impress potential employers. Therefore, we strongly encourage all of our students to adopt this approach and strive for excellence in their submissions.
