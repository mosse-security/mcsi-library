# Image Guidelines

In this quick tutorial:

**Guidelines**:

    * Image folder creation
    * Using images in your article
    * Naming image alt texts
    * Naming your images- technical
    * Naming your images- logical
    * Image selection

Suppose that you are writing on securing cloud-stored assets and named your article `how-to-encrypt-your-s3-contents` complying with the best article submission practices. You want to use some visuals to include in the article. Here are the visuals guideline.

## Image folder creation
Under your article's `how-to-encrypt-your-s3-contents` folder create a new folder named images to store your blog page's visuals.

## Using images in your article

Use the following syntax as a reference to the images your article contains:

`![aws encrypting s3 contents](images/bucket-assets-images.png)`

* ![aws-encrypting-s3-contents]: Contains your alt text
* (images/bucket-assets-images.png): Contains your images directory, image name and file extension.

## Naming image alt texts

Give a descriptive alt text to your images.
* Don't use generic terms like these: 
    * [alt text], 
    * [1], 
    * [image] 
    
* Name your alt texts or captions like these: 
    * [virus total details pointing multiple redirects], 
    * [list of indicator of compromise tools]
    * [aws encrypting s3 contents]
  
## Naming your images- technical

* No spaces.
* Use hyphens(-) to seperate words. Example: `bucket-assets-images.png`
* No special characters.
* No upper-case.

## Naming your images- logical

* Give meaningful names to your images.
* Don't use generic terms like these: 
    * image-1.webp, 
    * 2022-04-03-img1.png, 
    * 01.jpg
* Name your images relative to your article and keywords. Examples:
  * Article name: `Introduction to Malware Families`. An example image would be `djvu-ransomware-malware-families.jpeg`. Note the common keywords on the title, it is written in all lower-case and words are seperated by hyphens instead of spaces.
* Other meaningful examples: 
    * static-malware-analysis1.png, 
    * risk-management.jpg,
    * agile-waterfall-diagram.webp
  
## Image selection

* Don't use stock images
* Use original high-quality visuals


## Summary

While including images to your article, keep in mind relevancy, originality, correct naming structure and what you want to convey.
